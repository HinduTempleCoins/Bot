  "overview": "Synthesis demonstrating that Libya (ancient North Africa) served as the geographical and cultural origin point for Mediterranean civilization. Evidence spans mythology, genetics, archaeology, and linguistics to reveal that Greek, Egyptian, Phoenician, and Hebrew civilizations all trace their origins to a common Libyan source, extending further to connect with a 75,000-year timeline involving Denisovan populations, the Atlantean network, and modern genetic continuity.",
