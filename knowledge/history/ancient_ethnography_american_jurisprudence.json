  "overview": "American courts have long engaged with questions of ancient ethnography, genetic classification, and historical civilizations. From citizenship cases determining who qualified as 'white' under naturalization law, to property disputes invoking Phoenician commercial practices, to religious freedom cases examining ancient belief systems, the judiciary has repeatedly been called upon to interpret and apply knowledge about the ancient world. This document compiles court cases demonstrating this enduring characteristic of American jurisprudence.",

    "overview": "Between 1790 and 1952, American naturalization law restricted citizenship to 'free white persons' (and later 'persons of African nativity or descent').
