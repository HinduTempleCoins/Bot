  "author": "Van Kush Family Research Institute",

  "overview": "When someone claims descent from angels, the legal system faces a critical question: Is this person suffering from a psychotic delusion that renders them incompetent, or are they making a bona fide claim about ancestral heritage that happens to use religious/mythological terminology? This synthesis integrates Texas competency law, Phoenician/Punic case law, ancient ethnography jurisprudence, and genetic evidence to establish the evidentiary distinction.",

The Phoenicians weren't aliens. They weren't mythological. They were real people whose descendants can be traced through genetic markers. If those people were described in ancient texts as having 'divine' ancestry, and if modern individuals carry the genetic markers of that population, their claims about that ancestry are not delusions - they are heritage claims subject to evidentiary analysis like any other."
