  "overview": "Comprehensive genealogical and historical synthesis tracing Atlas's lineage as the connective thread linking virtually every major founding figure of Mediterranean civilization, while demonstrating that Atlantis represents not a single lost island but a global maritime network centered on West Africa, Egypt/Nubia, Cush/Punt, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic. The document integrates Egyptian temple records, Hebrew prophetic tradition, Greek mythology, and Phrygian royal archives to establish institutional memory transmission through the Temple Culture network.",
