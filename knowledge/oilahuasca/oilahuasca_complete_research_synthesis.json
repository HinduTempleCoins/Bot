    "title": "The Oilahuasca Theory",
    "definition": "Oilahuasca is a portmanteau combining 'oil' and 'ayahuasca' - coined by researcher Ron69 on the HerbPedia Wikidot. The name references the similar principle of enzyme manipulation used in ayahuasca (MAOI + DMT) but applied to culinary spices using CYP450 enzymes instead of monoamine oxidase.",
    "mechanism": "The theory describes how common culinary herbs and spices containing allylbenzene compounds can potentially produce psychoactive effects when consumed with specific enzyme inhibitors/inducers that modulate their metabolism.",
    "reported_effects": "Users have described effects similar to mescaline and MDMA, though individual variation is extreme.",
    "ron69_methodology": [
      "Beginning with nutmeg and anecdotal reports of psychoactive effects",
      "Systematic literature review identifying CYP450 enzyme involvement",
      "Discovering which CYP450 enzymes metabolize allylbenzenes",
      "Researching which herbs inhibit or induce these same enzymes",
      "Cross-referencing herbs that both contain allylbenzenes AND modulate CYP450",
      "Developing activation theory analogous to ayahuasca's MAOI mechanism"
    ],
    "key_insight": "The same principle used in ayahuasca (enzyme inhibition to prevent drug breakdown) could be applied using CYP450 enzymes instead of MAO.",
    "shulgin_framework": "Dr. Alexander Shulgin identified what he called the 'Ten Essential Oils' - allylbenzene compounds found in common spices that theoretically could be metabolized into psychoactive amphetamine-like compounds. Shulgin wrote: 'The major essential oil from that spice is myristicin, and it is the easiest source of MMDA. It has been reported that the passage of this oil through the liver of a rabbit will generate MMDA in that animal.'"
