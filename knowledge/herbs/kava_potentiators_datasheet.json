    "title": "The Oilahuasca Principle Applied to Kava",
    "description": "Just as Ayahuasca combines DMT with MAOIs to prevent breakdown, kava can be potentiated by targeting the enzymes and receptors involved in kavalactone metabolism and activity. Kava already contains FAAH and MAGL inhibitors (as established in the 2020 thread), plus yangonin binds CB1 at 720 nM - comparable to endocannabinoids. The key is understanding which compounds enhance these pathways."
