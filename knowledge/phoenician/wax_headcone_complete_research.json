    "historical_mystery": "For over a millennium of Egyptian art (3,550-2,000 years ago), cone-shaped objects appeared on people's heads in paintings, reliefs, and tomb decorations. No archaeologist had ever excavated one of the enigmatic objects, leading some scholars to think of Egyptian head cones as merely symbolic representations - the equivalent of the halos that appear on saints and angels in Christian iconography.",
