  "executive_summary": {
    "key_thesis": "Blockchain was built by anarchists for anarchists, but the movement has devolved into 'we made our money already' mentality. The time has come for Federalism over Anarchy - not Fox News federalism, but the original model: Moses and the Twelve Tribes.",
    "core_argument": "Multiple sovereign entities united under a common framework, each autonomous but part of a larger federation. This is the governance model that blockchain actually requires if it is to fulfill its potential as civilization infrastructure rather than speculative casino.",
    "current_moment": "El Salvador started it. Venezuela just got rid of Maduro. The moment is now. Bitcointown, Blueseed, seasteading, special economic zones, charter cities - these experiments point toward a future where blockchain-enabled governance becomes reality.",
    "fundamental_tension": "These experiments will only succeed if we understand the fundamental tension between anarchist origins and federalist necessity."
