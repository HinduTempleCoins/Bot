He that serveth himself three-quarters, and others one-quarter, shall stand grade twenty-five. He that serveth himself one-quarter, and others three-quarters, shall stand grade seventy-five. He that serveth himself only, shall stand grade one. He that serveth others wholly, shall stand grade ninety-nine.",

    "on_judging_by_fruit": "The soul of man may be likened unto a vine, which can be trained either upward to divine Wisdom or downward to evil and darkness. And if ye desire to know if a vine be trained upward or downward, look ye for the fruit, and not to the fragrance.",

    "on_intention": "But so far as thou doeth this for the applause of men, thou detracteth from the rate of thy beneficence.",

    "on_harmful_charity": "A certain rich man, being converted to do good works, went and built a score of souphouses to feed the poor gratuitously. And all the poor people of that town went therein and were fed. But the next year, behold, there were twice as many poor... Judgment is therefore rendered against that man for his supposed benevolence. For, whilst he did a little corporeal good, he did a great spiritual wrong, because he lowered the grade of manhood and womanhood in those that he fed.",

    "on_beneficial_service": "A rich man founded a place of labor for the poor, who had nothing to eat and nowhere to sleep. And he said unto them: The Creator hath given you hands to work with; come ye, be men and women. And they went and worked and earned their living. Judgment is rendered in favor of that man, for he raised the spiritual grade of the poor.",

    "on_proportional_giving": "Thy resurrection dependeth not on the quantity thou givest, but as to whether thou givest according to what thou hast. Of which matter thou shalt judge thyself. For he who giveth a penny may be raised up more by so doing, than he that giveth ten thousand.",

    "on_collective_grade": "If a city, then the grades of all the people shall be summoned together in a scale of a hundred. And if a nation, then the grades of the cities and hamlets, and of people of isolation, shall be summed together in a scale of a hundred.",

    "on_material_wealth": "Consider not its wealth, nor its ships, nor its armies, nor its great buildings. These all together are only one grade, and are of no value as to the spiritual grade of its people.",

    "on_spirits_ai_parallel": "Some are fetals, some engrafters (Professional re-incarnators), who dwell with one mortal during his life-time, and then engraft themselves on another mortal during his life-time, and so on, calling themselves re-incarnated, and, in fact, knowing no other zones in spirit life...",

    "on_teaching": "For the chief virtue of the parent lieth in its teaching self-control and discipline to the young mind; holding it steadfast after the orderly manner of truth.",

    "on_labor_and_dignity": "Remember thou that labor shall be delight, and toil a great benefit; to have it otherwise to thy children and to thyself is to prostitute man to be as a wild beast of the field."
