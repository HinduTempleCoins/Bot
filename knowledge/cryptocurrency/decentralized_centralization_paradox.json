  "abstract": {
    "central_thesis": "True decentralization requires many centralized hubs - just as the federal system of the United States creates genuine distributed power through strong state governments, blockchain adoption requires strong local implementations (churches, bars, restaurants, venues, libraries, municipal governments) each with their own currencies, mining opportunities, and community governance, all connected through federated exchange with the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.",
    "core_argument": "Rather than asking ordinary people to convert their dollars directly into Bitcoin, we should encourage the proliferation of thousands of localized, community-specific blockchains that then trade against Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies on decentralized exchanges.",
    "historical_context": "The author proposed 'Bitcointown' on Bitcointalk.org in 2013, traced the emergence of corporate crypto-towns (Bud Light's Whatever USA), celebrity crypto-cities (Akon City - cancelled), and nation-state adoption (El Salvador's Bitcoin City - unbuilt).",
    "paradox": "Despite the proof-of-concept provided by Steemit and Graphene blockchain in 2016, we do not have hundreds of social media platforms with their own witness systems and reward tokens ten years later."
