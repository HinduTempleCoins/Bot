      "extensions_and_commentary": "The extension of the two-carbon chain of mescaline by alpha-methylation to the three carbon chain of TMA approximately doubled the potency of the compound. And it was felt to be a completely logical possibility that, by extending it one more carbon atom, to the four carbon chain of alpha-ethyl-mescaline, it might double again. And following that logical progression, the doubling of potency with each additional carbon atom, the factor would be 2 to the 7th power by the alpha-octyl (or 256x that of mescaline, or a milligram as active dose) and with a side chain of a 70-carbon alkyl group (alpha-heptacontylmescaline) it would take just a single molecule to be intoxicating. This was rich fantasy stuff. As an active compound, just where would it go in the brain? With an 80-carbon side-chain, would one-thousandth of a single molecule be enough for a person? Or might a single molecule intoxicate a thousand people? And how long a chain on the alpha-position might be sufficient that, by merely writing down the structure on a piece of paper, you would get high? Maybe just conceiving the structure in your mind would do it. That is, after all, the way of homeopathy.\n\nMaybe it was just as well that this added two-carbon side-chain with lowered activity was already enough to disprove the doubling pattern. But by the time this non-activity had been learned, the alpha series had already been pushed out quite aways. The machinery of making the appropriate nitroalkane was straightforward, by reaction of the alkyl halide with nitrous acid, and separating the unwanted nitrite ester from the wanted nitroalkane by fractional distillation. The nitrostyrenes all formed reasonably although often in terrible yields, and reduced reasonably, and all formed crystalline picrates for isolation and crystalline hydrochloride salts for pharmacological manipulation. But since the first of these, AEM, was not active, there was no enthusiasm for tasting anything higher. This family was never published; why publish presumably inactive and thus uninteresting material?",

      "extensions_and_commentary": "This specific compound is probably the first sulfur-containing phenethylamine to have been evaluated as a potentially active CNS stimulant or psychedelic. It was a complete, total, absolute unknown. The first trials were made at the sub-microgram level, specifically at 0.25 micrograms, at 11:30 AM on September 3, 1975. Part of this extreme precaution was due to the uniqueness of a new heteroatom in a phenethylamine system. But part was due to the strange manic excitement that occurred at the time of the isolation and characterizing of the final product in the laboratory. Although it was certainly all placebo response, I was jumpy and unable to stay in the lab for more than a few minutes at a time. Maybe dust in the air? Maybe some skin contact with the free base? Now, I know there was nothing, but the possibility of extraordinary potency was real, and I did indeed wash everything down anyway. In fact, it took a total of 18 trials to work the experimental dosage up to as much as a single milligram. In retrospect, overly cautious. But retrospection, as they say, is cheap.\n\nThe 5 milligram experiment, briefly quoted from above, is the stuff of Chapter 14 of this book, important in that it gives an interesting example of some thought processes associated with psychedelic intoxication, ego-inflation, and what might be thought of as bits of mania. As is always the case with peak experiences that happen to be catalyzed by drugs, this extraordinary event could not be duplicated. At 7 milligrams there was an uneventful +1, and some 10 milligrams was needed to generate a full +3 experience. The first clue of the erratic nature of the Aleph family came from an independent assay by a colleague of mine, one who was very familiar with such states of consciousness, but for whom this was not a time for peak experiences. At 10 milligrams he told me that he had had only mild effects which he found relatively uninteresting.\n\nAs it stands, ALEPH remains relatively unexplored. Its two positional isomers are entered here as ORTHO-DOT and META-DOT. Three higher homologues have been more thoroughly looked at, and the generic name ALEPH (the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet) was given this group on the basis that they might have extraordinary properties in common. But the real treasure came in the exploring of the 2-carbon homologues, the compounds that make up the 2C-T family. Here, there proved to be much less uncertainty as to reasonable dosages, and much more richness in the subjective nature of the experience.",

One person had expressed his psychic isolation by taking and maintaining a fetal position in relative hibernation for several hours and with substantial amnesia; this at a four milligram dose. Yet another person, at fully twice this amount, was aware of a slight light-headedness that could in no way be measured as more than a bare threshold. But by the time this erratic nature had become apparent, the ALEPHS had been assigned and made, up to and including ALEPH-7.\n\nALEPH-3 was intended to be the methallylthio compound, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(beta-methallylthio)amphetamine. [Detailed synthesis attempted but abandoned - aldehyde obtained was 'a mess']. Several years later, this entire project was reinitiated, and the aldehyde was obtained as a yellow crystal, but again it was not pursued. At that time, the earlier try had been totally forgotten, and a brand new ALEPH- (or 2C-T-) number had been assigned; i.e., 20. Thus, the corresponding phenethylamine, had it ever been made, which it was not, would have been called either 2C-T-3 or 2C-T-20, and the amphetamine homologue would probably have been ALEPH-20.\n\nA closely related 2C-T-X compound was also started quite a while later - this was the allylthio homologue (2C-T-16). The nitrostyrene was made but has not yet been reduced to the final amine.\n\nALEPH-5 was to be the cyclohexylthio analogue. The nitrostyrene was prepared but 'sits there on the shelf to be reduced to ALEPH-5 some inspired day.' The two-carbon homologue will someday be called 2C-T-5 (if it is ever made).\n\nThe remaining members of this family, ALEPH-4, ALEPH-6, and ALEPH-7 have actually been prepared and they have all been entered here in Book II, under their own names.",

A psychedelic drug experience is a complex combination of many signals going all at the same time. Something like the sound of an oboe playing the notes of the A-major scale. There are events that occur in sequence, such as the initial A, followed by B, followed by C-sharp and on and on. That is the chronology of the experience, and it can be written down as a series of perceived phenomena. The notes of the scale. Black quarter notes, with flags at the tops of their staffs, going up the page of music.\n\nBut within each of these single events, during the sounding of the note 'A,' for example, there is a complex combination of harmonics being produced at the same time, including all components from the fundamental oscillation on up through all harmonics into the inaudible. This mixture defines the played instrument as being an oboe. Each component may be shared by many instruments, but the particular combination is the unique signature of the oboe.\n\nThis analogy applies precisely to the study of psychedelic drugs and their actions. Each drug has a chronology of effect, like the notes of the A-major scale. But there are many components of a drug's action, like the harmonics from the fundamental to the inaudible which, taken in concert, defines the drug. With musical instruments, these components can be shown as sine waves on an oscilloscope. One component, 22%, was a sine wave at a frequency of 1205 cycles, and a phase angle of +55°. But in psychopharmacology? There is no psychic oscilloscope. There are no easily defined and measured harmonics or phase angles. Certainly, any eventual definition of a drug will require some such dissection into components each of which makes some contribution to the complex whole. The mental process may some day be defined by a particular combination of these components. And one of them is this Beth state. It is a state of uncaring, of anhedonia, and of emotionlessness.\n\nMany drugs have a touch of this Beth state, ALEPH-7 more than most. If a sufficient alphabet of effects (I am using the Alephs, Beths, Gimels, and Daleths of the Hebrew as token starters only) were to be accumulated and defined, the actions of new materials might someday be more exactly documented. Could depression, euphoria, and disinhibition for example, all be eventually seen as being made up of their component parts, each contributing in some measured way to the sum, to the human experience? The psychologists of the world would be ecstatic. And drugs such as ALEPH-7 might be useful in helping to define one of these parts.",

Their findings are hard to evaluate, in that 200 milligrams was injected into a 3.75 kilogram cat (53 mg/Kg), or about twice the dosage that they used in their studies with metaescaline. Within 5 minutes there were indications of catatonia, and within a half hour the animal was unable to walk. This condition persisted for two days, at which time the animal died. Although this dose was many times that used in man, perhaps hints of the physical unease and long action are there to be gleaned. The consensus from over a half dozen experiments is that there is not enough value to be had to offset the body load experienced.\n\nA comment is needed on the strange name asymbescaline! In the marvelous world of chemical nomenclature, bi- (or di-) usually means two of something, and tri- and tetra- quite reasonably mean three and four of something. But occasionally there can be an ambiguity with bi (or tri or tetra) in that bi some-thing-or-other might be two something-or-others hooked together or it might be two things hooked onto a something-or-other. So, the former is called bi- and the latter is called bis-. This compound is not two escalines hooked together (bi-escaline) but is only one of them with two ethyl groups attached (bis-escaline or bescaline). And since there are two ways that this can be done (either symmetrically or asymmetrically) the symmetric one is called symbescaline (or SB for short) and this one is called asymbescaline (or ASB for short). To complete the terminology lecture, the term tri- becomes tris- (the name given for the drug with all three ethoxy groups present in place of the methoxys of mescaline) and the term tetra- mutates into the rather incredible tetrakis-!",

And to a large measure this is true with the 4-position homologues of mescaline. This butyl compound, B or Buscaline, had originally been patented in England in 1930 without any physical or pharmacological description, and the few physical studies that had involved it (lipophilic this and serotonin that) suggested that it was less active than mescaline.\n\nIn principle, the 5-, the 6-, the 7- and the on-up homologues might be called amylescaline (possibly pentescaline?), hexescaline, heptescaline (possibly septescaline), and God-knows-what-scaline. They would certainly be easily makeable, but there would be little value that could be anticipated from nibbling them. In keeping with the name B (for butoxy), these would be known as A (for amyloxy, as the use of a P could confuse pentoxy with propoxy), as H (for hexyloxy, but careful; this letter has been used occasionally for DMPEA, which is Homopiperonylamine), and as S (the H for heptyloxy has been consumed by the hexyloxy, so let's shift from the Greek hepta to the Latin septum for the number seven). It seems most likely that the toxic symptoms that might well come along with these phenethylamines would discourage the use of the dosage needed to affect the higher centers of the brain. The same generally negative feeling applies to the amphetamine counterparts 3C-B, 3C-A, 3C-H and 3C-S.\n\nA brief reiteration of the 2C-3C nomenclature, to avoid a possible misunderstanding. The drug 2C-B is so named in that it is the two-carbon chain analogue of the three-carbon chain compound DOB. The drug 3C-B is so named because it is the three-carbon chain analogue of the two-carbon chain compound Buscaline, or more simply, B.

Three milligrams of DOM is a winner, but even ten times this, thirty milligrams of N-methyl-DOM, is somewhat fuzzy. In the rabbit hyperthermia studies, this compound was some 25 times less active than DOM, so even animal tests say this is way down there in value. This particular measure suggests that the active level in man might be 75 milligrams. Well, maybe, but I am not at all comfortable in trying it at that level. In fact I do not intend to explore this any further whatsoever, unless there is a compelling reason, and I see no such reason. For the moment, let us leave this one to others, who might be more adventurous but less discriminating.\n\nIn browsing through my notes I discovered that I had made another N-substitution product of DOM. Efforts to fuse free-base DOM with the ethyl cyclopropane carboxylate failed, but the reaction between it and the acid chloride in pyridine gave the corresponding amide, with a mp of 156-157 °C from MeOH.

So, with DOM being active at maybe 5 milligrams, a logical prediction of the active level of BIS-TOM would be 750 milligrams.

      "extensions_and_commentary": "This compound, BOD, was the first exploratory member of a new family of phenethylamines. This family is called the BOX series, a code that is derived from the unique Beta-methOXy group which is their common feature. The letters B-O-X define an unchanging structural feature, and one needs only add a suffix letter to indicate a specific member of this family. That letter is directly related to the 4-position substituent. The letter 'D' is related to desoxy or methyl, as in DOM, and the other members of this family have a similar nomenclatural genesis. The term BOB comes from the bromine, BOH from the 2-hydroxy (beta-methoxy-2C-H), BOM from the methoxy, and so on.\n\nI came so close to giving one of these materials an extremely inflammatory name. The nitrostyrene that was to be reduced to the free base, was a beta-methoxy derivative, which dictates the BO-something name structure. And the 4-position substituent on the ring was a methylenedioxy group, which is symbolized by 'M'. The temptation was real, but the better angels of my nature prevailed.\n\nThis is as good a place as any to discuss the three-letter acronyms that have become attached to so many drugs. I have heard that the initializing of pharmaceuticals started with the first of the modern psychiatric drugs, chlorpromazine, which was given the name Thorazine by its makers. Whether this was an accident or a plan, every time some character in a movie is given a sedative by a nurse, the audience hears the magic word, Thorazine. Free advertisement forever. It is now the rule rather than the exception to see a drug identified with its three initials. PCP, LSD, DMT, STP, THC, GHB, MDA; they are all instantly recognized. Apparently there is some secret arm of the Government at work, trying to capture all three letter acronyms for themselves. There is the CIA, the DEA, the FBI, the FDA, the IRS, the INS, and many others. Maybe there is an unknown body, the United Amalgamation of Government Acronym Swipers, known only by its acronym, UAGAS.\n\nA small detour into biochemistry. The decarboxylation product of tyrosine is tyramine. The para-hydroxylation product of tyramine is dopamine. The beta-hydroxylation product of dopamine is norepinephrine. Now, where would one find tyrosine without the para-hydroxy group? Why, in phenylalanine, of course. And what is the decarboxylation product of phenylalanine? It is phenethylamine. And what is the beta-hydroxy derivative of phenethylamine? It is a compound known as phenylethanolamine. And what is the para-hydroxy derivative of phenylethanolamine? It is a compound which was first found in nature, not in the human, but in the salivary glands of the octopus. And so it is called octopamine. And I have always wanted to express my admiration and respect for whoever it was, who was curious enough about what might be in the salivary glands of the octopus, to actually look. My kind of scientist.\n\nA few words on optical isomers here. This is a family of compounds that has an asymmetric carbon atom in the aliphatic chain. It is called the beta-carbon atom, and it is the one that carries the methoxy group. So, there must always be two isomers, an 'R' and an 'S', or to use the older nomenclature, a 'D' and an 'L', and the synthetic material will always be the 50/50 mixture known as the racemate.\n\nThere is an ethoxy homologue of this compound (BOED) that has been synthesized and evaluated. At levels between 70 and 75 milligrams, there was a consistent experience of about 10 hours duration, distinctly less intense than BOD itself. Higher levels have not been explored.",

The BOH name for this member of the BOX family follows the convention discussed in the BOD recipe--with RHS for homopiperonylamine, the simplest of the muni-metro family, q.v. The demethylated homologue of BOH is BOHH, and is the methylenedioxy analogue of norepinephrine. It might well hydrolytically open up in the body to provide this neurotransmitter, and serve as some sort of transmitter in its own right. It is discussed under DME.\n\nMaybe there is something to the concept that when you imitate a neurotransmitter too closely, you get a hybrid gemisch of activity. The term \"pro-drug\" is used to identify a compound that may not be intrinsically active, but one which metabolizes in the body to provide an active drug. I feel the term should have been pre-drug, but pro-drug was the word that caught on. BOH may well act in the body as a pro-drug to norepinephrine, but with the temporary blocking of the polar functions with ether groups, it can gain access to the brain. And once there, it can be stripped of these shields and play a direct neurological role. I uncovered a very similar analogy in the tryptamine world some years ago. Just as norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter, so is serotonin. And I found that by putting an O-ether on the indolic phenol (to hide its polarity) and an alpha-methyl group next to the primary amine (to protect it from metabolic deaminase), it became an extremely potent, and most complex, psychedelic. This was the compound alpha,O-dimethylserotonin, or a,O-DMS. There is an uncanny analogy between this tryptamine and the phenethylamine BOH.\n\nSomehow the quiet voice deep inside me says, don't use too much, too quickly. Maybe one of the optical isomers is the body thing, and the other isomer is the mind thing. So far, only the racemic mixture has been tasted, to the best of my knowledge.",

      "extensions_and_commentary": "The usual method of making beta-ethanolamine such as this is through the reduction of the cyanohydrin of the corresponding benzaldehyde and, in fact, that method is described in the recipe for DME. This above procedure was actually part of an exploration of different agents that might be used in the reduction of the intermediate nitroalkane. This product was the unexpected result of trying zinc.\n\nWhy the potent cardiovascular effect seen by this compound? There are a couple of points that might argue for some adrenolytic toxicity. This material is a beta-ethanolamine and, with maybe one or two exceptions, clinically used beta-receptor blockers are beta-ethanolamines. In fact, a few of these so-called beta-blockers actually have two methoxy groups on the aromatic rings, also a property of BOHD. The antidiabetic drug Butaxamine (BW 64-9 in the code of Burroughs Wellcome) is identical to BOHD except that the 4-methyl group is on the alpha-carbon instead, and there is a tertiary butyl group on the nitrogen atom. Another point involves the proximity of the beta-hydroxy group and the methoxyl oxygen atom in the 2-position of the ring. There is going to be a strong hydrogen-bonding with this orientation, with the formation of a stable six-membered ring. This might help obscure the hydrophilic nature of the free hydroxyl group and allow the compound to pass into the brain easily. If this group is masked by an easily removed group such as an acetate ester, one gets the compound beta-acetoxy-3,4-dimethoxy-4-methylphenethylamine (BOAD) which is similar to BOHD as a hypotensive.\n\nThe code-naming procedure used here (and elsewhere here in Book II) is: (1) to use RBOS as the alert to there being an oxygen on the benzyl carbon of a phenethylamine (it is a benzyl alcohol); (2) if there is just one more letter (a third and last letter) it will identify the 2C-X parent from which it has been derived [RBS comes from 2C-B, RDS comes from 2C-D, RHS comes from homopiperonylamine (MDPEA) rather than from 2C-H, RMS comes from mescaline, and in every case the beta-substituent is a methoxy group]; and (3) if there are four letters, then the fourth letter is as above, and the third letter (the next to last letter) is the substituent on that benzylic oxygen. With a three letter code, the substituent is a methyl group, an RHS for a third letter of four makes it a hydroxyl group, and an RAS for the third letter is an acetyl group, and an RES is for an ethyl group. A similar sort of cryptographic music was composed by Du Pont in their three-number codes for the Freons. The first number was one less than the number of carbons in the molecule, the second number was one more than the number of hydrogens in the molecule, the third number was the exact number of fluorines in the molecule, and the rest of the bonds were filled with chlorines, Thus Freon 11 (really Freon 011) was trichlorofluoromethane and Freon 116 was hexafluoroethane.\n\nComplex, yes. But both systems are completely straightforward, and flexible for future creations. A few additional examples of similar beta-ethanolamines are scattered throughout Book II and they have, in general, proved to be uninteresting, at least as potential psychedelic compounds.",

      "extensions_and_commentary": "Four quotations were chosen arbitrarily from literally hundreds that have worked their ways into the files. The vast majority are positive, ranging from the colorful to the ecstatic. But not all are. There are people who choose not to go into the corporeal but, rather, prefer the out-of-body experience. They express discomfort with 2C-B, and seem to lean more to the Ketamine form of altered state, one which dissociates body from mind.\n\nThere have been reports of several overdoses that prove the intrinsic safety of this compound. Prove is used here in the classic British sense; i.e., to challenge. \"The proof of the pudding is in the eating,\" is not a verification of quality, but an inquiry into the quality itself. (The French simplify all this by using two separate verbs for prove.) One overdose was intentional, the other accidental.\n\n(with 64 mg) I found only mild visual and emotional effects at the 20 milligram dose, so I took the remaining 44 milligrams. I was propelled into something not of my choosing. Everything that was alive was completely fearsome. I could look at a picture of a bush, and it was just that, a picture, and it posed no threat to me. Then my gaze moved to the right, and caught a bush growing outside the window, and I was petrified. A life-form I could not understand, and thus could not control. And I felt that my own life-form was not a bit more controllable. This was from the comments of a physician who assured me that he saw no neurological concerns during this dramatic and frightening experience.\n\n(with 100 mg) I had weighed correctly. I had simply picked up the wrong vial. And my death was to be a consequence of a totally stupid mistake. I wanted to walk outside, but there was a swimming pool there and I didn't dare fall into it. A person may believe that he has prepared himself for his own death, but when the moment comes, he is completely alone, and totally unprepared. Why now? Why me? Two hours later, I knew that I would live after all, and the experience became really marvelous. But the moment of facing death is a unique experience. In my case, I will some day meet it again, and I fear that I will be no more comfortable with it then than I was just now. This was from the comments of a psychologist who will, without doubt, use psychedelics again in the future, as a probe into the unknown.\n\nMany of the reports that have come in over the years have mentioned the combination of MDMA and 2C-B. The most successful reports have followed a program in which the two drugs are not used at the same time, nor even too closely spaced. It appears that the optimum time for the 2C-B is at, or just before, the final baseline recovery of the MDMA. It is as if the mental and emotional discoveries can be mobilized, and something done about them. This combination has several enthusiastic advocates in the psychotherapy world, and should be the basis of careful research when these materials become legal, and accepted by the medical community.\n\nA generalized spectrum of 2C-B action can be gleaned from the many reports that have been written describing its effects. (1) There is a steep dose response curve. Over the 12 to 24 milligram range, every 2 milligrams can make a profound increase or change of response. Initially, one should go lightly, and increase the dosage in subsequent trials by small increments. A commonly used term for a level that produces a just perceptible effect is \"museum level.\" This is a slightly-over-threshold level which allows public activities (such as viewing paintings in a museum or scenery watching as a passenger in a car) to be entered into without attracting attention. There can be considerable discomfort associated with being in the public eye, with higher doses. (2) The 2C-B experience is one of the shortest of any major psychedelic drug. Wherever you might be, hang on. In an hour or so you will be approaching familiar territory again. (3) If there is anything ever found to be an effective aphrodisiac, it will probably be patterned after 2C-B in structure.\n\nThere are two \"Tweetios\" known that are related to 2C-B. (See recipe #23 for the origin of this phrase.) The 2-EtO- homologue of 2C-B is 4-bromo-2-ethoxy-5-methoxyphenethylamine, or 2CB-2ETO. The unbrominated benzaldehyde (2-ethoxy-5-methoxybenzaldehyde) had a melting point of 47.5-48.5 °C, the unbrominated nitrostyrene intermediate a melting point of 76-77 °C, and the final hydrochloride a melting point of 185-186 °C. The hydrobromide salt had a melting point of 168.5-169.5 °C. It seems that one gets about as much effect as can be had, with a dosage of about 15 milligrams, and increases above this, to 30 and to 50 milligrams merely prolong the activity (from about 3 hours to perhaps 6 hours). At no dose was there an intensity that in any way resembled that of 2C-B.\n\nThe 2,5-DiEtO- homologue of 2C-B is 4-bromo-2,5-diethoxyphenethylamine, or 2CB-2,5-DIETO. The unbrominated impure benzaldehyde (2,5-diethoxybenzaldehyde) had a melting point of about 57 °C, the unbrominated impure nitrostyrene intermediate a melting point of about 60 °C, and the final hydrochloride a melting point of 230-231 °C. The hydrobromide salt had a melting point of 192-193 °C. At levels of 55 milligrams, there was only a restless sleep, and strange dreams. The active level is not yet known.\n\nI have been told of some studies that have involved a positional rearrangement analogue of 2C-B. This is 2-bromo-4,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (or 6-BR-DMPEA). This would be the product of the elemental bromination of DMPEA, and it has been assayed as the hydrobromide salt. Apparently, the intravenous injection of 60 milligrams gave a rapid rush, with intense visual effects reported, largely yellow and black. Orally, there may be some activity at the 400 to 500 milligram area, but the reports described mainly sleep disturbance. This would suggest a stimulant component. The N-methyl homologue of this rearranged compound was even less active.",

Yet, the comment above, on the high level of 150 milligrams, is a direct quote from the use of this compound in Germany (where it is called LE-25) in therapeutic research.\n\nThis is probably the most dramatic example of the loss of potency from an amphetamine (DOM, active at maybe 3 milligrams) to a phenethylamine (only one tenth as active). It is so often the case that the first of a series is not the most interesting nor the most potent member. As intriguing and as difficult-to-define as the 2C-D story might be, the next higher homologue of this set, 2C-E, is maximally active at the 15 to 20 milligram level, and is, without any question, a complete psychedelic.\n\nThe N-monomethyl and the N,N-dimethyl homologues of 2C-D have been synthesized from 2C-D. The N-monomethyl compound was obtained by the quaternization of the Schiff's base formed between 2C-D and benzaldehyde with methyl sulfate, followed by hydrolysis; the hydrochloride salt had a melting point of 150-151 °C, from EtOH. The N,N-dimethyl compound resulted from the action of formaldehyde-formic acid on 2C-D; the hydrochloride salt had a melting point of 168-169 °C from EtOH/ether. These two compounds were some ten times less effective in interfering with conditioned responses in experimental rats. There is no report of their having been explored in man.\n\n[ Erowid Addition: Darrell Lemaire's Contribution: In January, 2015, chemist and psychonaut Darrell Lemaire announced that he had decided to come out publicly as the author \"Lazar\" who conducted the \"extensive study\" referenced in the following paragraph. For many years, Mr. Lemaire had preferred to remain anonymous, but the Shulgin Team is helping add credit for his work back into the literature. See Darrell Lemaire Character Vault.]\n\nI have learned of an extensive study of ethoxy homologues of a number of the phenethylamines in the 2C-X series; they have been collectively called the \"Tweetios.\" This Sylvester and Tweety-bird allusion came directly from the compulsive habit of trying to alleviate the boredom of driving long distances (not under the influence of anything) by the attempt to pronounce the license plates of cars as they passed. The first of this series of compounds had a name that indicated that there was an ethoxy group at the 2-position, or 2-EtO, or Tweetio, and the rest is history. In every compound to be found in the 2C-X family, there are two methoxy groups, one at the 2-position and one at the 5-position. There are thus three possible tweetio compounds, a 2-EtO-, a 5-EtO- and a 2,5-di-EtO-. Those that have been evaluated in man are included after each of the 2C-X's that has served as the prototype. In general, the 2-EtO- compounds have a shorter duration and a lower potency, the 5-EtO- compounds have a relatively unchanged potency and a longer time duration; the 2,5-di-EtO- homologues are very weak, if active at all.\n\nThe 2-EtO-homologue of 2C-D is 2-ethoxy-5-methoxy-4-methylphenethylamine, or 2CD-2ETO. The benzaldehyde (2-ethoxy-5-methoxy-4-tolualdehyde) had a melting point of 60.5-61 °C, the nitrostyrene intermediate a melting point of 110.5-111.5 °C, and the final hydrochloride a melting point of 207-208 °C. The hydrobromide salt had a melting point of 171-173 °C. At levels of 60 milligrams, there was the feeling of closeness between couples, without an appreciable state of intoxication. The duration was about 4 hours.\n\nThe 5-EtO- homologue of 2C-D is 5-ethoxy-2-methoxy-4-methylphenethylamine, or 2CD-5ETO. The benzaldehyde (5-ethoxy-2-ethoxy-4-tolualdehyde) had a melting point of 81-82 °C, and the details of this synthesis are given in the recipe for IRIS. The nitrostyrene intermediate had a melting point of 112.5-113.5 °C and the final hydrochloride salt had a melting point of 197-198 °C. The hydrobromide salt had a melting point of 158-159 °C. At dosage levels of 40 to 50 milligrams, there was a slow, gradual climb to the full effects that were noted in about 2 hours. The experience was largely free from excitement, but with a friendly openness and outgoingness that allowed easy talk, interaction, humor, and a healthy appetite. The duration of effects was 12 hours.\n\nThe 2,5-di-EtO- homologue of 2C-D is 2,5-diethoxy-4-methylphenethylamine, or 2CD-2,5-DIETO. The benzaldehyde (2,5-diethoxy-4-tolualdehyde) had a melting point of 102-103 °C, the nitrostyrene intermediate a melting point of 108-109 °C, and the final hydrochloride salt a melting point of 251-252 °C. At a level of 55 milligrams, a plus one was reached, and what effects there were, were gone after four hours.",

I have one report of an intravenous administration of 20 milligrams, and the response was described as overwhelming. The effects peaked at about 5 minutes and lasted for perhaps 15 minutes.\n\nThe halogens represent a small group of atoms that are unique for a couple of reasons. They are all located in a single column of the periodic table, being monovalent and negative. That means that they can be reasonably stable things when attached to an aromatic nucleus. But, being monovalent, they cannot be modified or extended in any way. Thus, they are kind of a dead end, at least as far as the 2C-X series is considered. The heaviest, iodine, was explored as the phenethylamine, as 2C-I, and as the amphetamine as DOI. These are the most potent. The next lighter is bromine, where the phenethylamine is 2C-B and the amphetamine is DOB. These two are a bit less potent, and are by far the most broadly explored of all the halides. Here, in the above recipe, we have the chlorine counterpart, 2C-C. There is also the corresponding amphetamine DOC. These are less potent still, and much less explored. Why? Perhaps because chlorine is a gas and troublesome to handle (bromine is a liquid, and iodine is a solid). The fluorine analogue is yet harder to make, and requires procedures that are indirect, because fluorine (the lightest of all the halides) is not only a gas, but is dangerous to handle and does not react in the usual halogen way. There will be mention made of 2C-F, but DOF is still unexplored.\n\nThe treatment of the 2C-B phthalimide described above, with cuprous cyanide rather than cuprous chloride, gave rise to the cyano analog which, on hydrolysis with hydrazine, yielded 2,5-dimethoxy-4-cyanophenethylamine (2C-CN). Hydrolysis of this with hot, strong base gave the corresponding acid, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-carboxyphenethylamine, 2C-COOH.

Nothing heavier. When everything had expanded enough to cool things sufficiently for the first actual matter to form, all was simply very energetic protons and neutrons. These were banging into one-another, making deuterium nuclei, and some of these got banged up even all the way to helium, but every time a helium nucleus collided with a particle of mass one, to try for something with mass five, the products simply couldn't exist. Both Lithium-5 and Helium-5 have the impossible half-lives of 10 to the minus 21 seconds. Hence, in the primordial soup, the only way to get into something heavier than helium was to have a collision between a couple of the relatively scarcer heavy nuclei, or to have a three body collision. Both of these would be extremely rare events, statistically. And if a few got through, there was another forbidden barrier at mass 8, since Beryllium-8 has a half life of 10 to the minus 16 seconds. So everything had to wait for a few suns to burn down so that they could process enough helium into heavy atoms, to achieve some nuclear chemistry that was not allowed in the early history of the universe.\n\nAnd in the same way, there were two nearly insurmountable barriers encountered in getting to 2C-G-4 and G-4. The simple act of methylating an aromatic hydroxyl group provided mixtures that could only be resolved into components by some pretty intricate maneuvers. And when that product was indeed gotten, the conversion of it into a simple aromatic aldehyde resisted the classic procedures completely, either giving complex messes, or nothing. And even now, with these two hurdles successfully passed, the presumed simple last step has not yet been done. The product 2C-G-4 lies just one synthetic step (the LAH reduction) away from completion, and the equally fascinating G-4 also that one last reduction step from being completed. Having gotten through the worst of the swamp, let's get into the lab and finish up this challenge. They will both be active compounds.",

The area under the curve, so to speak. By these measures, this phenethylamine is a record breaker, in that it is not only amongst the most potent, but it goes on and on and on.\n\nThere are a couple of chemical commentaries. One, the miserable phenol-to-ether-to-aldehyde series of steps, so maddeningly unsatisfactory in the 2C-G-4 process, was completely comfortable here. The reactions rolled, and the yields were most satisfactory. Secondly, this is one of the few phenethylamines that is a racemate. The strange geometry of the norbornane ring carries within it a chiral character, so this compound is potentially resolvable into two optically active forms. That might be quite a task, but it would have the value of providing for the first time a pair of isomers that were asymmetric in the 3,4-aliphatic part of the molecule. To the extent that some insight into the geometry of the receptor site can be gleaned from the absolute configurations of active agonists, here is a compound where the subtle variations are over there at the ring substitution area of the structure, rather than at the well-explored alpha-carbon atom. Some day I might try to resolve this drug into its optical isomers. But I suspect that it might be quite difficult.\n\nA number of chemical variations of 2C-G-5 are obvious. The dihydroxybenzonorbornane compound that was the starting point of all this was certainly the adduct of cyclopentadiene and benzoquinone, with the double bond reduced. The same chemistry with 1,3-cyclohexadiene would give a two-carbon bridge instead of the one-carbon bridge of norbornane and, after hydrogenation, would provide a non-chiral analog with two ethylene bridges between the 3- and 4-position carbons. This is a cyclohexane ring connected, by its 1- and 4-positions, to the two methyl groups of 2C-G. With six carbons in this aliphatic mess, the compound is probably best called 2C-G-6. It should be easily made, and it is certain to be very potent. And there are potentially several other Diels Alder dienes that might serve with benzoquinone as the dieneophile. There are aliphatic things such as hexa-2,4-diene and 2,3-dimethylbutadiene. The textbooks are filled with dozens of diene candidates, and benzoquinone will always provide the two oxygens needed for the eventual 2,5-dimethoxy groups of the phenethylamine.",

      "extensions_and_commentary": "The frequent comparisons between 2C-I and 2C-B stem, without doubt, from a bit of chemical suggestion. The two compounds have structures that are truly analogous, in technical terms. In one, there is a strategically located iodine atom, and in the other, an identically placed bromine atom. These are directly above and below one-another in the periodic table. And what is particularly maddening to the synthetic diddler, is that they cannot be lengthened, or shortened, or squooshed around in any way. You can't make a longer and narrower version of a bromine atom, as you can do with, say, a butyl group. You've got what you've got, like it or not. No subtle variations.\n\nBut, on the brighter side of the picture, you have a heavy atom here, and this atom is intrinsic to the central activity of the compound. So, these materials are naturals for radio-labelling experiments. 2C-I has been made radioactive with radio-iodine, but the most impressive findings have been made with the 3-carbon analog, DOI.\n\nOne quotation from an observer of a group experiment is enclosed; an experiment with zero milligrams being taken. This is a instructive observation of what has been called a contact high.\n\nThere is one Iodotweetio known. In Scrabble, would you challenge a word that had seven of its eleven letters as vowels? Especially if the vowels were, specifically, iooeeio? It sounds just a little like the noise coming out of Old McDonald's farm. But a Tweetio there is, namely, the 2-EtO-homologue of 2C-I. This is 2-ethoxy-4-iodo-5-methoxyphenethylamine, or 2CI-2ETO. The hydrochloride salt was a white, crystalline product with a melting point of 175-175.5 °C. The threshold level of activity was seen at an oral dose of 5 milligrams, and the generated effects were completely dispersed in a couple of hours. Most interestingly, larger doses, of up to 50 milligrams orally, seem to produce no more intense an effect, but simply to stretch out this threshold for an additional couple of hours. At no level that has been tried, has 2CI-2EtO produced even a plus-two response.\n\nWhere else can one go, from 2C-I? The iodine is the fourth, and the last of the so-called halogens, at the bottom of the classical periodic table. But, thanks to the miracles that have accompanied us into the nuclear age, there is a fifth halide now known, Astatine. All of its isotopes are radioactive, however, and it seems unlikely that there will ever be an entry (other than this one) for 2,5-dimethoxy-4-astatophenethylamine. What might be speculated as to its activity? Probably similar in potency to 2C-I, requiring maybe 10 or 20 milligrams. The duration would be dicey to measure, since the isotope with the longest known half-life is half decayed in about 8 hours, and the longest lived natural isotope (for those who insist on natural rather than man-made things) is half decayed in less than a minute. Two predictions would be pretty solid. You might have quite a job accumulating your 10 milligrams of Astatine, as the most that has so far been made at one time is only about 0.05 micrograms, approximately a millionth of the amount needed. And the second prediction? You would not survive the screaming radiation that would bombard you if you could get the needed 5 or 10 milligrams of radio-astatine onto that magic 4-position, and the resulting 2C-A into your tummy!",

And with very few exceptions, the 2- and the 5- are methoxyl groups.\n\nThe sulfur analogues in this area, compounds with an alkylthio group at the 4-position of the 2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine backbone, are the 2C-T things. The replacement of a sulfur with an oxygen, quite rightly, should give rise to the 2C-O counterparts. And they have been given the same numbering system that was bestowed upon the RTS series. 2C-T-4 was the 4-isopropylthio compound and one of the most interesting of this family. And so, quite reasonably, the oxygen counterpart should be the 2C-O-4 analogue, and should be one of the first explored.\n\nThe extension of the 4-alkoxy-group led to the discovery of the TMA-2 --MEM--MIPM--MPM--MBM series of amphetamine analogues. The 2-carbon counterparts of these would be a fascinating series to explore, I thought, if there was some encouragement to be had from a preliminary try in this field.\n\nThis was a first shot in the dark, the actual trial example, and it certainly didn't provide much encouragement. The three-carbon analogue, MIPM, was made (q.v.) but not explored, following the disappointing trials of MPM. If this area is ever re-opened, the numbering should reasonably follow the sulfur materials. The 4-ethoxy material would be 2C-O-2, the 4-(n)-propoxy compound 2C-O-7, and the 4-(n)-butoxy compound 2C-O-19. These are the exact analogues of 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7, and 2C-T-19, resp., and the 2-carbon homologues of MEM, MPM, and MBM. The simplest member of this series, the methyl counterpart, is 2C-O, and it is the obvious analogue of 2C-T. This is also called 2,4,5-TMPEA, and its story is presented elsewhere.\n\nBut, with the probable low eventual potency of 2C-O-4, I feel that the 2C-O series will not be an exciting one.",

      "extensions_and_commentary": "With an entirely new hetero atom in the molecule (the selenium), and with clear indications that large dosages would be needed (100 milligrams or more), some discretion was felt desirable. There was certainly an odd taste and an odd smell. I remember some early biochemical work where selenium replaced sulfur in some amino acid chemistry, and things got pretty toxic. It might be appropriate to get some general animal toxicity data before exploring those dosages that might get to a +++.\n\nWhat doors are opened by the observation that the selenium analog of 2C-T is an active compound? The potency appears to be in the same ball park, whether there is a sulfur atom or a selenium atom there.\n\nFrom the point of view of the thing that is hung onto the hetero-atom, the selenium, the most active (and as first approximation the most safe) analogue would be the same ones that are the most potent with sulfur. These would probably be the Se-ethyl, the Se-propyl, or the Se-isopropyl, the analogs of S-ethyl, S-propyl, and S-isopropyl. If one were to be systematic, these would be called 2C-SE-2, 2C-SE-4, and 2C-SE-7. And a very special place might be held for 2C-SE-21, the analogue of 2C-T-21. Not only is this of high potential potency, but it would certainly be the first time that both fluorine and selenium are in the same centrally active drug. In fact, might not this compound, 2C-SE, be the first compound active within the human CNS with a selenium atom in it? It is certainly the first psychedelic with this atom in it!\n\nFrom the point of view of the hetero-atom itself, there are two more known below selenium in the Periodic Table. Each deserves some special comment. The next atom, directly below selenium, is tellurium. It is more metallic, and its compounds have a worse smell yet. I heard a story about a German chemist, many years ago, who was carrying a vial of dibutyl telluride in his pocket in a passenger coach from here to there in Germany, back at about the turn of the century. It fell to the floor and broke. No one could remain in the car, and no amount of decontamination could effectively make the smell tolerable. Scratch one railway coach. But the compound, 2C-TE, would be readily makeable. Dimethyl ditelluride is a known thing.\n\nHowever, the atom below tellurium (and at the bottom of that particular column of the Periodic Table) is the element polonium. Here one must deal in terms of theory, as far as human activity goes, since there are no non-radioactive isotopes of polonium. The only readily available isotope is that with mass 210, which is also called Radium F, and is an alpha-particle emitter. If this were ever to be put into a living organism, and if it were to seek out and hang around some particular site of action, that area would be thoroughly and completely cooked by alpha-particle emission. It would be a fun academic exercise to make 2C-PO (2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylpoloneophenethylamine), but in no way could it ever go into anyone. I knew an eminent physiologist named Dr. Hardin Jones (now dead) who always argued that the continuing use of drugs would burn out the pleasure center of the brain. It is a certainty that 2C-PO would, quite literally, do this. If I ever made it, I would call it HARDINAMINE in his honor.\n\nThere was an interesting observation associated with the making of 2C-SE. In the synthesis of many of the sulfur compounds (of the 2C-T family) it was quite common to find, when there was a quantity of some organic sulfide let go as a by-product of a reaction on a warm summer night, a number of flies coming into the lab to pay a visit. On the first synthesis of the starting material for 2C-SE, a quantity of CH3SeH was let go into the environment. Within minutes, there were two beautiful dragonflies in the lab. A coincidence certainly, but somehow, it was a nice message to receive.",

Although the first of these (this compound, called 2C-T) was prepared at the same time as ALEPH-1, there was a lapse of about four years between their trials. The relatively low potency of 2C-T was a bit discouraging. But the methodical pursuit of the higher 2C-T's (to parallel the higher ALEPHs) proved to be a treasure house, and they have been explored much further than any of the ALEPHs.\n\nA note on the RTS in 2C-T. Many, in fact most, of the 2C's have their name based on the last letter of the amphetamine prototype. 2C-B from DOB, 2C-C from DOC, 2C-I from DOI, 2C-N from DON, etc. And since the original name for ALEPH-1 was DOT (the desoxy- and a thiomethyl group at the 4-position), the 2C-T naming followed this general pattern. And as a note on the subsequent numbering, they (both the ALEPHs and the 2C-T's) are assigned numbers as they are thought up. There is no structural significance in the number but they have been, like the houses on the streets in residential Tokyo, assigned numbers in strict historical order, documenting the sequence of construction rather than the relative position down the side of the street.\n\nBoth of the homologous mono-ethoxy Tweetios of 2C-T have been synthesized and evaluated. The 2-EtO-homologue of 2C-T is 2-ethoxy-5-methoxy-4-methylthiophenethylamine, or 2CT-2ETO. The benzaldehyde (2-ethoxy-5-methoxy-4-(methylthio)benzaldehyde) was an oil, the nitrostyrene intermediate had a melting point of 137-138 °C, and the final hydrochloride a melting point of 215-216 °C. The effects were felt very quickly, and there was a blurring of vision. However, the highest dose tried, 50 milligrams, was not able to produce a greater-than-plus one state, and what did occur, lasted for only 4 hours.\n\nThe 5-EtO-homologue of 2C-T is 5-ethoxy-2-methoxy-4-methylthio-phenethylamine, or 2CT-5ETO. The benzaldehyde (5-ethoxy-2-methoxy-4-(methyl-thio)benzaldehyde) was impure, and had a melting point of about 66 °C, the nitrostyrene intermediate a melting point of 133-134 °C, and the final hydrochloride a melting point of 184-185 °C. There was a body awareness and modest eyes-closed visuals following the use of 30 milligrams of 2CT-5ETO. The experience was quiet, peaceful, contemplative, and insightful. The duration was perhaps 15 hours and Halcion was needed to allow sleep. There were a lot of dreams, and the next day was restful.",

      "extensions_and_commentary": "There is a considerable parallel between 2C-T-2 and 2C-T-7, and both have proven to be excellent tools for introspection. The differences are largely physical. With 2C-T-2, there is more of a tendency to have physical disturbances such as nausea and diarrhea. And the experience is distinctly shorter. With 2C-T-7, physical disturbances are less common, but you are into the effects for almost twice as long. Both have been frequently used in therapy as follow-ups to MDMA.\n\nA point of potential misidentification should be mentioned here. 2C-T-2 has occasionally been called, simply, T-2. This abbreviated nickname has also been used for T-2 Toxin, a mycotoxin of the Tricothecene group, formed mainly by the Fusarium spp. This is the infamous \"warfare agent\" in Southeast Asia, which was finally identified as bee feces rather than a Soviet military adventure. T-2 and 2C-T-2 are radically different compounds.\n\nAll three Tweetios of 2C-T-2 have been made and looked at through human eyes. The 2-EtO-homologue of 2C-T-2 is 2-ethoxy-4-ethylthio-5-methoxyphenethylamine, or 2CT2-2ETO. The benzaldehyde (2-ethoxy-4-ethylthio-5-methoxybenzaldehyde) had a melting point of 73-75 °C, the nitrostyrene intermediate a melting point of 122-123 °C, and the final hydrochloride a melting point of 202-204 °C. Fifty milligrams was a completely effective level. The effects were felt very quickly. Vision was blurred, and there were intense eyes-closed visuals and the generation of a pleasant, contemplative mood. Baseline was re-established in five or six hours, but sleep was restless, with weird dreams. Nasal administration showed considerable variation between individuals, but a typical dose was 10 milligrams.\n\nThe 5-EtO-homologue of 2C-T-2 is 5-ethoxy-4-ethylthio-2-methoxyphenethylamine, or 2CT2-5ETO. The benzaldehyde (5-ethoxy-4-ethylthio-2-methoxybenzaldehyde) had a melting point of 49 °C, but it was impure. The nitrostyrene intermediate melted at 107-108 °C, and the final hydrochloride had a melting point of 180 °C. At levels of 20 milligrams, there was a slow, gentle climb to a full effect at the third or fourth hour. The flooding of thoughts and easy conversation lasted for many hours, and on some occasion a sedative was needed at the 16 hour point. There was a feeling of being drained for the following day or two. Some intoxication was still noted in the second day. Again it is true here, as had been stated as a generality, that the 5-Tweetio analogues have potencies similar to that of the parent compound, but show a much longer duration. The nickname of \"forever yours\" had been applied. There may indeed be insight, but 24 hours' worth is an awful lot of insight.\n\nThe 2,5-DiEtO-homologue of 2C-T-2 is 2,5-diethoxy-4-ethylthiophenethylamine, or 2CT2-2,5DIETO. The benzaldehyde, 2,5-diethoxy-4-(ethylthio)benzaldehyde, had a melting point of 84-85 °C, the nitrostyrene intermediate a melting point of 123-124 °C, and the final hydrochloride a melting point of 220-221 °C. Levels that were evaluated from 10 to 50 milligrams were not particularly different in intensity, but were progressively longer in duration. At 50 milligrams there was a nervousness and edginess during the early part of the experience, but for the next several hours there was evident both energy and high attentiveness. There were few if any sensory alterations. There were no negatives on the following day. The duration was perhaps nine hours.",

This is an example of a whole class of compounds that I have called the pseudos, or the psi-compounds. Pseudo- as a prefix in the literary world generally stands for \"false.\" A pseudopod is a thing that looks like a foot, but isn't one. A pseudonym is a fictitious name. But in chemistry, it has quite a different meaning. If something has a common name, and there is a second form (or isomer, or shape, or orientation) that is possible and it doesn't have a common name, it can be given the name of the first form with a pseudo- attached. Ephedrine is the erythro-isomer of N-methyl-beta-hydroxyamphetamine. There is a second stereoisomer, the threo- isomer, but it has no trivial name. So it is called pseudoephedrine, or the \"Sudafed\" of sinus decongestant fame.\n\nThe pseudo-psychedelics are the 2,4,6-trisubstituted counterparts of the 2,4,5-trisubstituted psychedelics. Almost all of the 2,5-dimethoxy-4-something-or-other compounds are active and interesting whether they be phenethylamines or amphetamines, and it is an exciting fact that the 2,6-dimethoxy-4-something-or-other compounds are going be just as active and just as interesting. A number of examples have already been mentioned. TMA-2 is 2,4,5-trimethoxyamphetamine (a 2,5-dimethoxy-substituted compound with a methoxyl at the 4-position). The pseudo- analogue is TMA-6 (2,4,6-trimethoxyamphetamine) and it is every bit as potent and fascinating. Z-7 could be called pseudo-DOM, and although it is quite a bit down in potency, it is an active drug and will both demand and receive much more clinical study some day.\n\nWill the other 2,4,5-things spawn 2,4,6-things that are active? Without a shadow of a doubt. Chemically, they are much more difficult to synthesize. The 2,5-dimethoxy orientation made the 4-position a natural and easy target. The 2,6-dimethoxy orientation pushes for 3-substitution, and the 4-position is completely unnatural. Tricks are needed, but tricks have now been found. The above synthesis of pseudo-2C-T-4 shows one such trick. This is, in my opinion, the exciting chemistry and psychopharmacology of the next decade. Well over half of all the psychedelic drugs mentioned in Book II are 2,4,5-trisubstituted compounds, and every one of them has a (potentially active) 2,4,6-pseudo-counterpart.\n\nIt goes yet further. The antidepressant series of \"Ariadne\" compounds are 1-phenyl-2-aminobutanes. But the 1-phenyl is again a 2,4,5-trisubstituted compound. The 2,4,6-isomer will give rise to a pseudo-Ariadne family, and I will bet that they too will be antidepressants. The 1-phenyl-2-aminobutane analog of psi-2C-T-4 is the 2,4,6-analogue and it has been prepared as far as the nitrostyrene. It has not yet been reduced, so it is not yet been evaluated, but it could be a most remarkable psychopharmacological probe.\n\nAnd it goes yet yet further. Think back to the six possible TMA's. TMA and TMA-3 were relatively inactive. And TMA-2 and TMA-6 were the interesting ones. The first gave rise to the last twenty years of psychedelic chemistry, and the other (as speculated upon above) will give rise to the forthcoming ten years. But what of TMA-4 and TMA-5? Both showed activity that was more than TMA but less than that of the -2 or -6 isomers. Could they, some day, provoke yet other families of psychedelics? Maybe the 3-position of these two might be focal points of leverage as to psychological activity. What are the letters that follow y in the Greek alphabet? If I remember correctly, the next letter is the last letter, omega. So, I guess that Nature is trying to tell us something, that the -4 and -5 isomers will not engender interesting families. What a pity. The chemistry is so unthinkably difficult that it would have been a true challenge. My next incarnation, maybe?",

The benzaldehyde (2-ethoxy-5-methoxy-4-(n-propylthio)benzaldehyde had a melting point of 69-71 °C, the nitrostyrene intermediate a melting point of 106-106.5 °C, and the final hydrochloride a melting point of 187-189 °C.

This nifty reaction with di-(t)-butyl disulfide worked so well, that three additional disulfides that were at hand were immediately thrown into the chemical program, with the quick assignment of the names 2C-T-10, 2C-T-11, and 2C-T-12.\n\nThe lithiated dimethoxybenzene reaction with 2,2-dipyridyl disulfide produced 2,5-dimethoxyphenyl 2-pyridyl sulfide which distilled at 135-150 °C at 0.4 mm/Hg and could be recrystallized from cyclohexane containing 2% EtOH to give a product that melted at 66-67.5 °C. Anal. (C13H13NO2S) C,H. This would have produced 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(2-pyridylthio)phenethylamine (2C-T-10) but it was never pursued.\n\nThe same reaction with di-(4-bromophenyl) disulfide produced 2,5-dimethoxyphenyl 4-bromophenyl sulfide which distilled at 150-170 °C at 0.5 mm/Hg and could be recrystallized from MeOH to give a product that melted at 72-73 °C.

One additional effort was made to prepare a 2C-T-X thing with a sulfur-nitrogen bond.

      "extensions_and_commentary": "An interesting, and quite logical, habit that seems to always pop up when a lot of talk and energy become directed at a specific compound, is the habit of using a nickname for it. The Tweetios are an example, and in the 2C-T-X family I had mentioned the term SESQUI. Here, this compound was called NIMITZ, for the obvious reason that the major freeway from Oakland to San Jose, the Nimitz freeway, was also called State Highway 17. Its name has been changed to Interstate 880, and I guess it could now only be used as a reference point if efforts were being made for a 2C-T-880.\n\nThe reason that 2C-T-17 is of special theoretic interest is that it is one of the very first of the active psychedelic compounds (along with 2C-G-5) to have a potential optically active center on the side of the ring away from the nitrogen atom. One of the oldest and best studied variants of the phenethylamine chain are the alpha-methyl homologues, the substituted amphetamines. Here there is an asymmetric carbon atom right next to the amine group, allowing the molecule to be prepared in either a right-hand way or a left-hand way. The \"R\" or the \"S\" isomer. And in the several studies that have looked at such isomers separately, it has always been the \"R\" isomer that has carried the psychedelic effects. This probably says something about the nitrogen end, the metabolic end, the \"north\" end of the receptor site that recognizes these compounds, and suggests that there is some intrinsic asymmetry in the area that binds near to the basic nitrogen atom.\n\nBut very little is known of the receptor's \"south\" end, so to speak, the geometry of the area where the opposite end of the molecule has to fit. Here, with 2C-T-17, there is a secondary butyl group, and this contains an asymmetric carbon atom. But now this center of asymmetry is clear across the benzene ring from the nitrogen, and should certainly be in some entirely new part of the receptor site. Why not make this compound with the \"R\" and the \"S\" forms in this new and unusual location? Why not, indeed! Why not call them the right-lane and the left lane of the Nimitz? Fortunately, both \"R\" and \"S\" secondary butyl alcohols were easily obtained, and the synthesis given above for the racemic compound was paralleled for each of these isomers, separately. Is there any chemistry that is different with the specific optical isomers from that which has been reported with the racemic? There certainly is for the first step, since the butyl alcohols rather than the butyl bromides must be used, and this first step must go by inversion, and it cannot be allowed any racemization (loss of the optical purity of the chiral center).\n\nThe synthesis of 2C-T-17 \"R\" required starting with the \"S\" isomer of secondary butanol. The \"S\" 2-butanol in petroleum ether gave the lithium salt with butyllithium which was treated with tosyl chloride (freshly crystallized from naphtha, hexane washed, used in toluene solution) and the solvent was removed. The addition of 2,5-dimethoxythiophenol, anhydrous potassium carbonate, and DMF produced \"S\"-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl s-butyl sulfide. The conversion to \"R\"-2,5-dimethoxy-4-(s-butylthio)benzaldehyde (which melted at 78-79 °C compared to 86-87 °C for the racemic counterpart) and its conversion in turn to the nitrostyrene, \"S\"-2,5-dimethoxy-4-(s)-butylthio-beta-nitrostyrene which melted at 70-71 °C compared to 68-69 °C for the racemic counterpart, followed the specific recipes above. The preparation of the intermediates to 2C-T-17 \"S\" follows the above precisely, but starting with \"R\" 2-butanol instead. And it is at these nitrostyrene stages that this project stands at the moment.\n\nIt would be fascinating if one of the two optically active 2C-T-17's carried all of the central activity, and the other, none of it. What is more likely is that the spectrum of effects will be teased apart, with one isomer responsible for some of them and the other isomer responsible for the others. Then, again, maybe the south end of the receptor site in the brain is totally symmetric, and the two optical antipodes will be indistinguishable.\n\nAn incidental bit of trivia--yet another bit of evidence that we are all totally asymmetric in our personal body chemistry. \"R\" and \"S\" secondary butanols smell different. The \"R\" has a subtle smell, which is rather fragrant. The \"S\" is stronger, hits the nasal passages harder, and reminds one of isopropanol more than does the \"R\" isomer.",

The motivation for the use of the beta-fluoroethyl group can be seen under the discussion of DOEF, where there was an amalgamation of two lines of reasoning: the imitation of potent serotonin agonists with a need of including an atom (the fluorine) that is potentially labelable with a positron emitter. And the mass-18 isotope of fluorine, with a half-life of just under 2 hours, is ideal for many biological studies. In fact, much of the research work being carried out by the Nuclear Medicine group in Berkeley is based on the analogy between a halogen atom and a beta-fluoroethyl group. There are some similarities in pharmacology so that if there is a bromine or an iodo atom present in a drug, it is a fair guess that the corresponding beta-fluoroethyl would also be active. In a sense, the cute (and chemically impossible) idea of putting a bromo atom on the sulfur of the 2C-T family is nicely satisfied by using the beta-fluoroethyl group instead (which is chemically completely possible).\n\nA logical extension of 2C-T-21 is the three carbon amphetamine analogue which should be, by comparing structures and activities, a very potent and interesting material in its own rights. This would be 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(2-fluoroethylthio)amphetamine or, following the nomenclature used with the earlier members of this series, ALEPH-21. A solution of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(2-fluoroethylthio)benzaldehyde (see earlier in this recipe) in nitroethane with ammonium acetate gave 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-(2-fluoroethylthio)phenyl)-2-nitropropene as yellow-orange crystals from MeOH with a melting point of 102-104 °C. And that is where the project now stands. It has not yet been reduced to the amine.\n\nThis phenethylamine, 2C-T-21, was the last of the 2C-T's to be completed. A couple of other sulfur analogues have been given numbers, and have been started, but the syntheses are still at some intermediate state.\n\nThe (n)-butyl compound, named 2C-T-19, has been taken to the nitrostyrene stage. Reaction between 2,5-dimethoxythiophenol and (n)-butylbromide with KOH gave 2,5-dimethoxyphenyl (n)-butyl sulfide as a colorless oil. This, with phosphorus oxychloride and N-methylformanilide, provided 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(n-butylthio)benzaldehyde as pale orange solids from MeOH, with a melting point of 78-79 °C. This, with nitromethane and ammonium acetate, gave 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(n-butylthio)-beta-nitrostyrene, with a melting point of 133-134 °C from either IPA or acetonitrile.\n\nThe 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl compound, which I have named 2C-T-22, has been taken to the benzaldehyde stage. Reaction between 2,5-dimethoxythiophenol and 2,2,2-trifluoroethyliodide with KOH gives 2,5-dimethoxyphenyl 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl sulfide as a very pale amber oil. This, with phosphorus oxychloride and N-methylformanilide provided 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzaldehyde as crystals that proved to be exceedingly difficult to purify. Yellow solids can be obtained from several solvents, and they melt in the 70 °C area. The initially isolated fraction melted at 69-72 °C and showed three major spots by both TLC and GCMS. The largest GC peak was the correct product with a parent peak of 280 m/e, and cracking fragments at 154 and 234 m/e. A small sample was finally obtained from hexane with a melting point of 78-79 °C but I am not sure that even it is particularly pure. Not surprisingly, the reaction of this crude benzaldehyde with nitromethane and ammonium acetate gave a nitrostyrene product that was a complex mixture. And there that project also rests.\n\nA couple of additional efforts warrant comment. The reaction between trifluoromethyliodide and 2,5-dimethoxythiophenol should have produced 2,5-dimethoxyphenyl trifluoromethyl sulfide, but it didn't produce anything. And one more. What about a bare thio group at the 4-position in this 2C-T-family? Maybe this can be protected through everything as the disulfide, and be reduced at the last step! The disulfide, 2,5-dimethoxyphenyl disulfide (see under 2C-T-15) was aimed towards the needed bis-aldehyde with phosphorus oxychloride and N-methylformanilide, but all that came out of this were black oils and tars. This has also been abandoned for now.\n\nAnd it has just occurred to me that there is yet another effort that is certainly worth making, inspired by the observation that 2,2-difluoroethyl iodide is commercially available and not prohibitively expensive. It, with 2,5-dimethoxythiophenol, and following the obvious steps to the aldehyde, the nitrostyrene, and the final amine, would produce 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(2,2-difluoroethylthio)phenethylamine hydrochloride. It lies exactly half way between the highly potent 2C-T-21 (the mono-fluoro), and the yet to be finished 2C-T-22 (the trifluoro). Let's be weird, and call it 2C-T-21.5. I will wager mucho that it will be very potent.",

It is possible to imagine that, in such individuals, the effects of substituting trideuteromethyl groups for normal methyl groups might result in psychopharmacological differences of action. Two reports exist that describe metabolic products of mescaline that have lost this methyl group on the 4-position oxygen. It is possible that these might be produced in abnormal quantities in mentally ill subjects. There are also similar reports of the 3-methoxyl group being demethylated in man. Here, studies with 3,5-D (3,5-bis-trideuteromethoxy-4-methoxyphenethylamine) might reveal some differences in quantitative responses in man. These are extremely minor metabolites, however.

The three remaining are: (1) 3,5-D (4-methoxy-3,5-bis-trideuteromethoxyphenethylamine); (2) 2,6-D (2,6-di-deutero-3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine); and (3) alpha-D (alpha,alpha-dideutero-3,4,5-tri-methoxyphenethylamine). I fully expect both 3,5-D and 2,6-D to be indistinguishable from mescaline in effect, since it is known that not much metabolism takes place in man at these locations of the molecule.\n\nThe last compound, alpha-D, could be quite a different matter. The principal metabolite of mescaline is 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylacetic acid, and this product requires enzymatic attack at the exact position where the deuteriums will be located. To the extent that they are harder to remove (come off more slowly or to a lesser degree), to that extent the molecule will be more potent in man, and the dosage required for effects will be less. The compound will be easily made by the reduction of 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylacetonitrile with lithium aluminum deuteride. And if there is a believable difference between alpha-D and mescaline, it will be necessary to synthesize each of the two optically active alpha-mono-deutero analogs. That will be quite a challenge.\n\nSome years ago I performed a fascinating series of experiments with another isotopically labeled mescaline derivative. This was beta-14C labeled material, which I self-administered on three occasions, at three different levels. One dosage was with 350 milligrams, a second a few weeks later was with 4 milligrams, and a third was a few weeks later yet, with about 60 micrograms. In each case, exactly the same absolute quantity of radioactivity was administered, so the metabolic distribution was equally visible. Only the weight dosage was different. Urinary analysis was run for each experiment for the presence of unchanged mescaline, and for the primary metabolite, 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylacetic acid. The smaller the dosage, the proportionately larger amount of mescaline was oxidized to the inactive acetic acid, and the smaller amount was excreted in an unchanged state. It seemed to me that there might be a finite capacity of the body to oxidatively deaminate mescaline, and at larger and larger dosages, this capacity became increasingly depleted. Perhaps this is why mescaline requires such a large dosage to be effective in man.",

Some of these warts are things attached with an oxygen atom; there are some of these in every single compound in this story. No oxygen atom, no psychedelic effect. Without them, one has stimulants or, more frequently, no effects at all.\n\nBut the removal of an oxygen atom (in those cases where there is more than one) can radically change the nature of the effects seen. This is the exact meaning of the term 'desoxy.' 'Des', without, and 'oxy', the oxygen. Since this drug is simply the structure of mescaline with the oxygen at the 4-position plucked out of the picture, the first impulse was to abbreviate this compound as DOM for des-oxymescaline. However, a long, long time ago, in a universe far, far away, a compound was synthesized that had a methoxy group replaced by a methyl, and it was already named DOM. This was the first of the STP analogs, and the initials stood for desoxy (DO, losing an oxygen) and methyl (M, having it replaced with a methyl group). These are two different worlds. One M stands for Mescaline, and the other M stands for Methyl. Let's call it 4-desoxymescaline, or simply DESOXY, and be exact.\n\nThis drug is a prime example of a pharmacological challenge directed to the metabolic attack at the 4-position as a mechanism for the expression of biological activity. A methoxy group there would allow easy removal of the methyl group from the oxygen by some demethylation process, but a bare methyl group there cannot be removed by any simple process. It must be removed by a very difficult oxidation.\n\nThis is not the first time that oxygen atoms have been removed from the mescaline molecule. Both the 3,5-dideoxymescaline (3,5-dimethyl-4-methoxyphenethylamine) and 3,4,5-trideoxymescaline (also called desoxymescaline in the literature, but really tri-desoxymescaline or 3,4,5-trimethylphenethylamine) have been studied in the cat, and have shown extraordinary pharmacological profiles of CNS action. The trimethyl compound showed behavior that was interpreted as being intense mental turmoil, accompanied by a startling rise in body temperature. The significance is hard to determine, in that LSD gave similar responses in the cat, but mescaline was without effects at all. No human studies have been made on these compounds, just animal studies. But they might prove upon trial in man to be most revealing. They would have to be performed with exceptional care.\n\nThe 3-carbon chain amphetamines that correspond to these mescaline look-alikes with one or more methoxy groups replaced with methyl groups, are largely untested and would require independent and novel syntheses. The 3,4,5-trimethylamphetamine is known, and is known to be very hard on experimental cats.\n\nA mescaline analogue with a bromo atom in place of the 4-methoxyl group is an analogue of mescaline in exactly the same way that DOB (a very potent amphetamine) is an analog of TMA-2 (the original trisubstituted amphetamine). This analogue, 3,5-dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine, has been found to be a most effective serotonin agonist, and it is a possibility that it could be a most potent phenethylamine.

The 60 milligram report given above is the highest level that I personally know of having been tried in man, and there is no hint as to what might be found at a fully active dose, or just where that dose might be. It might be fully speedy. It might be fully psychedelic. It might give a cardiovascular push that would be scary. Studies of 2,4-DMA on vascular strips (associated with serotonin action) were not impressive in comparison with structurally related psychedelics, and it seems as if its action might involve norepinephrine release. It is a reasonable guess that there would be cardio-vascular activity at higher levels. But it will only be with human trials, someday, that the answer will be known for sure.\n\nThe meta-orientation of the two methoxyl groups does, however, greatly increase the susceptibility of the aromatic ring to electrophilic attack. This is one of the three possible meta-dimethoxy substituted amphetamines, and it is the best studied one in the pursuit of potential radio-halogen substituted brain blood-flow agents. This strategy is discussed under IDNNA; the other two meta-compounds are discussed under 3,4-DMA.\n\nThe homologues of 2,4-DMA that were iodinated (or occasionally fluorinated) were mono- or di-alkylated on the nitrogen, and the precursor that was common to all was the corresponding acetone. The above nitrostyrene, 1-(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-nitropropene, was reduced in acetic acid with elemental iron, and the base-washed extracts stripped of solvent and distilled (125-145 °C at 0.5 mm/Hg) to give 2,4-dimethoxyphenylacetone as a water-white oil. The principal reductive amination product of this, the one that was most thoroughly explored with various halogenation schemes, was obtained by the reaction of 2,4-dimethoxyphenylacetone with dimethylamine and sodium cyanoborohydride. This product, 2,4-dimethoxy-N,N-dimethylamphetamine or 2,4-DNNA, distilled at 105-115 °C at 0.4 mm/Hg and formed a perchlorate salt that melted at 98-98.5 °C.\n\nA large family of other N-substituted homologues of 2,4-DMA were similarly prepared from the above ketone and sodium cyanoborohydride. Methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, isopropylamine and hexylamine gave the corresponding N-alkyl homologues. The N,N-diethyl homologue was made from the primary amine, 2,4-DMA itself, with acetaldehyde and sodium cyanoborohydride but the product, N,N-diethyl-2,4-dimethoxyamphetamine, could not be converted into a crystalline hydrochloride salt.\n\nYet another variation on these structures was launched, again with the design of making radio-iodination targets which are not psychedelic and thus might be useful clinically. In this variation, the nitrogen atom substitution pattern was held constant, with two methyl groups, as were the ring locations of the two oxygen atoms. But the identities of the alkyl groups on these oxygen atoms were varied. Following this reaction scheme, five amphetamine homologues of 2,4-DMA were made, three with the 4-methoxy group maintained but the 2-position extended, and two with both groups extended symmetrically. These are: (1) N,N-dimethyl-2-ethoxy-4-methoxyamphetamine; (2) 2-(n)-butyloxy-N,N-dimethyl-4-methoxy-amphetamine; (3) 2-(n)-decyloxy-N,N-dimethylamphetamine; (4) 2,4-diethoxy-N,N-dimethylamphetamine; and (5) N,N-dimethyl-2,4-di-(i)-propoxyamphetamine. I believe that most of these have been iodinated and assayed in rats, and several of them appear quite promising. But none of them have been assayed in man, yet. The bromination product of 2,4-DMA (5-bromo-2,4-dimethoxyamphetamine, 5-Br-2,4-DMA) is way down in activity (see its recipe, separately). Since all iodo analogues are of about the same potency as the bromo counterparts, and since the addition of two methyl groups on the nitrogen does not appear to enhance central activity, I feel the iodination products of these N,N-dialkyl-dialkoxyamphetamines would not have any interesting psychopharmacology.\n\nThere is something vaguely counterproductive, in my evaluation of things, when the goal of a research project is to avoid activity rather than to create it. Although this chemistry was completely fascinating and could have produced the world's best positron-emitting, brain-scanning diagnostic compound, I feel it quite unlikely that it would have produced the world's best insight-revealing, empathy-enhancing psychedelic, so this research direction never totally caught my fancy. I went on to other things.",

      "extensions_and_commentary": "The qualitative information on 2,5-DMA is very sparse. I was up to a 1+ with 80 milligrams of the hydrochloride, and since it appeared to be totally a physical trip with tremors and some cardiovascular push and nothing of a sensory nature, I chose to explore it no further. A report from South America found the intoxication to be largely pleasant (this, at 75 milligrams), with an enhanced interest in one's surroundings, but no perceptual changes, no overt stimulation, and no gross physiological effects other than a slight mydriasis (dilation of the pupils). I have also been told of a single trial of 250 milligrams of the tartrate (this is equivalent to somewhere in the 150-200 milligram range of the hydrochloride salt, depending upon the acid/base ratio of the tartrate salt) with some \"speedy\" effects but still no sensory changes. A seizure of capsules reported by the drug law enforcement authorities some 20 years ago found that each contained some 200 milligrams of the hydrobromide salt. This is equivalent to 170 milligrams of the hydrochloride salt, and suggests that level may be an effective dosage.\n\nAn intriguing, but little studied, analogue of 2,5-DMA is the compound with methyls in place of the methoxyls. 2,5-Dimethylamphetamine has been looked at, in man, as a potential anorexic, but there is little effect even at 150 milligrams. The 3,4-isomer, 3,4-dimethylamphetamine or xylopropamine, is an adrenergic agent and it has been found to be an analgesic in man at as little as 10 milligrams. This was assayed, rather remarkably, by attaching electrodes to the tooth fillings of the experimental subjects. But with this base, cardiovascular effects were not observed until doses of about 100 milligrams were administered, and toxic effects (nausea and vomiting) were reported at 150 milligrams. There was no suggestion of anything psychedelic.\n\nAll three isomers of monomethylamphetamine have also been looked at in man. The ortho- and meta-isomers, 2-methyl- (and 3-methyl- ) amphetamine are weak anorexics. At doses of up to 150 milligrams orally, there were signs of stimulation noted--talkativeness and loss of appetite. The para-isomer, 4-methyl-amphetamine or Aptrol, is more potent. At 75 milligrams (orally, in man) there is clear adrenergic stimulation, and at twice this dosage there are signs of mild toxicity such as salivation, coughing and vomiting.\n\nThere is a mystery, at least to me, concerning the commercial production of 2,5-DMA. At regular intervals, there is a public announcement of the production quotas that are requested or allowed by the Drug Enforcement Administration, for drugs that have been placed in Schedules I or II. In the Schedule I category there are usually listed amounts such as a gram of this, and a few grams of that. These are probably for analytical purposes, since there are no medical uses, by definition, for drugs in this Schedule. But there is a staggering quantity of 2,5-DMA requested, regularly. Quantities in the many tens of millions of grams, quantities that vie with medical mainstays such as codeine and morphine. I have heard that this material is used in the photographic industry, but I have no facts. Somewhere I am sure that there is someone who has to keep a lot of very careful books!\n\nIn the area of psychedelic drugs, the value of 2,5-DMA is mainly in its role as a precursor to the preparation of materials that can come from a direct electrophilic attack on the activated 4-position. These uses can be found under things such as DOB and DOI and DON. The radio-halogenation of N-substituted homologues of 2,5-DMA with hypoiodite or hypofluorite is part of an extensive study underway in the search for radio-labeled brain blood flow agents. The rationale for this work is to be found in the commentary under IDNNA. In essence it has been found that the N-substitution or N,N-disubstitution of 2,5-DMA where the 4-position is unsubstituted and thus available for the introduction of a radioactive nucleus can give rise to potentially useful drugs. Most of these 2,5-dimethoxy exploratory compounds were made by the reductive alkylation of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(radio)iodophenylacetone, using various mono or dialkyl amines. This, too, is described under IDNNA.\n\nHowever, the study of various direct iodinations and fluoridations that would have the N,N-dimethyl substitution on the amphetamine nitrogen atom, would require the 4-proteo- analogue, and this was made from the above nitrostyrene. A solution of the above nitrostyrene, 22.3 g 1-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-nitropropene in 100 mL acetic acid was added to a suspension of elemental iron in acetic acid (45 g in 250 mL) and worked up with water and base washing to give, after distillation at 92-106 °C at 0.35 mm/Hg, 13.8 g 2,5-dimethoxyphenylacetone as a pale yellow oil. This underwent reductive amination with dimethylamine hydrochloride in MeOH solution, using sodium cyanoborohydride, to give the target compound 2,5-dimethoxy-N,N-dimethylamphetamine oxalate with a melting point of 133-134 °C (4.6 g ketone gave 1.38 g of salt). Anal. (C15H23NO6) C,H. It has also been prepared by the N,N-dimethylation of 2,5-DMA directly, with formaldehyde and formic acid. This has been called 2,5-DNNA, or IDNNA without the \"I.\" This intermediate, 2,5-DNNA, underwent direct radioiodination with labeled iodine monochloride in the presence of perchloric acid to give IDNNA with a 40% incorporation of isotope. Reaction with labeled acetyl hypofluorite, on the other hand, gave only a 2% in-corporation of the radio-isotope. This latter compound is, chemically, 4-fluoro-2,5-dimethoxy-N,N-dimethylamphetamine and, using the reasoning suggested above and with IDNNA, might best be encoded FDNNA.\n\nThe 2,5-dimethylamphetamine analogue mentioned above was also explored in this IDNNA concept. The commercially available 2,5-dimethylbenzaldehyde was converted to the nitrostyrene with nitroethane (1-(2,5-dimethylphenyl)-2-nitropropene, yellow crystals with a melting point of 24.5-25.5 °C) which reacted with elemental iron in acetic acid to give the ketone 2,5-dimethylphenylacetone (boiling at 140-150 °C at 0.4 mm/Hg). Reductive amination with dimethylamine and sodium cyanoborohydride gave 2,5-DMNNA (2,5,N,N-tetramethylamphetamine) as a clear oil with a boiling point of 115-125 °C at 0.35 mm/Hg. It gave poor yields of the 4-fluoro analogue with acetyl hypofluorite.\n\nAll of these latter materials remain unevaluated in man.",

      "extensions_and_commentary": "These \"Qualitative Comments\" are not explicit quotations from people who had taken 3,4-DMA. They are written descriptions by the observers who had given 3,4-DMA to psychiatric patients. This is one of the most outrageous chapters in the books on military medicine. The chemical warfare group within the U.S. Army explored many potential psychedelics by administering them to innocent patients with not even a thought of obtaining informed consent. These experiments took place at the New York State Psychiatric Institute (amongst other places) in the early 1960's. The Edgewood Arsenal code name for 3,4-DMA was EA-1316. A few non-military studies have indicated that 3,4-DMA is orally active at 160 milligrams, and so probably its potency by this more conventional route would fall midway between that of mescaline and of MDA. The 3-methoxy-4-other-than-methoxy things (such as hydroxy, ethoxy, allyloxy and methyl) are mentioned in the recipe for MEPEA. The alpha-ethyl homologue of 3,4-DMA, 2-amino-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)butane, and of other DMA's are discussed under the recipe for ARIADNE.\n\nThere are a total of six possible amphetamine molecules with two methoxyl groups attached. The 3,4-orientation has always been the most appealing to the life scientists as this is the positional substitution pattern found in the natural neuro-chemicals dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine. These latter two are called noradrenalin and adrenalin in England. Two adjacent hydroxy groups represent the catechol in the well known word catecholamines. You might read in a textbook, \"This is where nature placed the groups when she put the compounds in our brains. So that is where the groups might be the most interesting in a psychedelic.\" Why? I have never understood this kind of reasoning. If a possible psychedelic has just the exact oxygen positioning of a neurotransmitter, then, voila, that's why it is active. And if a possible psychedelic has some positioning of these oxygen atoms that is different than that of a neurotransmitter? Then voila again. That's why it is active. Both sound equally reasonable to me, and neither one even begins to address the fundamental question, how do the psychedelic drugs do what they do? A study in the human animal of the intimate effects of one of these neurotransmitter analogues might bring us a little bit closer to answering this fundamental question. But maybe it wouldn't, after all. Nothing has made much sense so far! Anyway, 3,4-DMA is one of the ten essential amphetamines that can, in theory, arise from the ten essential oils of the spice and herb trade. In this case, the origins are methyl eugenol and methyl isoeugenol.\n\nTwo of these \"different\" isomers, 2,4-DMA and 2,5-DMA, have already been discussed in their own separate recipes. And the remaining three of the six possible DMA's that are \"different\" have been made and studied pharmacologically in animals but not in man. These are the 2,3-DMA, 2,6-DMA and the 3,5-DMA isomers. The products of their reaction with elemental bromine are discussed under META-DOB.\n\nBoth the 2,6- and the 3,5-isomers, as the N,N-dimethyl homologues, have been looked at as potential radio-halogen recipients in the search for positron-emitting brain blood-flow indicators, as discussed in the recipe for IDNNA. Both were made from the appropriate nitrostyrene via the corresponding phenylacetone.\n\nThe 2,6-isomer was derived from 2,6-dimethoxybenzaldehyde. This, in nitroethane and ammonium acetate, gave the nitrostyrene as canary-yellow crystals from MeOH that melted at 101.5-102.5 °C. Elemental iron in acetic acid converted this nitrostyrene to 2,6-dimethoxyphenylacetone (a water-white oil with boiling point of 95-105 °C at 0.4 mm/Hg. Anal. (C11H14O3) C,H) and reductive amination with dimethylamine and sodium cyanoborohydride gave 2,6-dimethoxy-N,N-di-methylamphetamine perchlorate (2,6-DNNA) with a melting point of 109-110 °C. This base was readily fluorinated with 18F acetylhypofluorite and iodinated with chloramine-T-oxidized 122I iodide ion. It was also halogenated with (non-radioactive) bromine and iodine monochloride to give the corresponding 3-bromo-(and 3-iodo)-2,6-dimethoxy-N,N-dimethylamphetamines but these, in turn, did not react with radioactive acetyl hypofluorite.\n\nThe 3,5-isomer followed precisely the same flow sheet. 3,5-Dimethoxybenzaldehyde gave the nitrostyrene (with a melting point of 87-88 °C), the phenylacetone (with a boiling point of 110-130 °C at 0.3 mm/Hg) and the product 3,5-dimethoxy-N,N-dimethylamphetamine perchlorate (3,5-DNNA) with a melting point of 100-101 °C. This also reacted readily with 18F acetylhypofluorite and 122I-hypoiodite. Several alpha-ethyl homologues of these compounds have also been discussed in the recipe for ARIADNE.",

Under the discussion of members of the BOX series, there is a methylenedioxyphenethylamine with a methoxyl group at the beta-position, and it is called BOH (q.v.). There, a reasonable code name for this specific compound is given, namely BOHH. RBOS stands for the beta-oxygen function on a phenethylamine; this is the heart of the BOX family. The RHS which is the third letter of BOHH stands for the free hydroxyl group. And the final RHS is for homopiperonylamine (which is the trivial name for the compound without the hydroxyl group). BOHH, or 3,4-methylenedioxy-beta-hydroxyphenethylamine, or 3,4-methylenedioxy-beta-ethanolamine, has also be assayed in man at up to 100 milligrams without any effects, and must be considered, as of now, to be inactive centrally.

      "extensions_and_commentary": "DMMDA was the first of the tetraoxygenated amphetamine derivatives that was ever explored in man, back in 1962. And it is not easy to find an acceptable single phrase to describe its action or an acceptable number to describe its potency. I have put the value of 10 mescaline units (M.U.) into the literature and this would imply that maybe 30 milligrams was an active dose. This is probably too low, and some day I would like to run an experiment with the entire research group with this compound to see just what it really does.\n\nThe essential oil that corresponds to DMMDA is, of course, apiole from the Oil of Parsley, which again ties together the spice world and the amphetamine world. And there is isoapiole, also a natural thing. This pair represents the ring-substitution pattern of one of the ten essential oils and DMMDA is one of the ten essential amphetamines.\n\nSeveral people have asked me what I thought about the potential activity of a compound with a methyl group added to DMMDA. One of these possibilities would be the N-methylated derivative, 2,5-dimethoxy-N-methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, or METHYL-DMMDA (or DMMDMA for the dimethoxy-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine nomenclature). It is a MDMA analogue, and is described in the recipe for METHYL-MMDA-2.\n\nThe placement of an added methyl group onto the beta-position of DMMDA, rather than on the nitrogen atom, produces a pair of stereoisomeric homologues. These are the threo- (or-trans-) and erythro- (or cis)-2,5-dimethoxy-beta-methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamines. They have never been assigned trivial names (my original codes for them were S-1495 and S-1496 which is not too intuitively informative). Their chemically proper names would have the 2-amino-3-substituted phenylbutane form. The synthesis of these DMMDA homologues started with the reduction of the nitrosyrene to the ketone (see under METHYL-MMDA-2 for this preparation), followed by methylation with fresh sodium isopropoxide and methyl iodide, to give the beta-methyl product. This formed the two possible oximes, one with a mp of 120 °C, and the other from MeOH with a mp of 146 °C. The 120 °C oxime, with fresh sodium ethoxide gave threo-2-amino-3-(2,5-dimethoxy-3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)butane hydrochloride. This salt had a mp of 247-249 °C. The 146 °C oxime gave erythro-2-amino-3-(2,5-dimethoxy-3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)butane hydrochloride with a mp of 188-189 °C. The threo-isomer showed a possible threshold effect at 80 milligrams, with hyperventilation and perhaps some mental muddiness. The erythro-isomer showed no effects, but it had been taken up only to 10 milligrams.\n\nThe only other beta-methyl homologue of an active material that was explored chemically, was related to MDA. The ketone (3,4-piperonylacetone, see under MDMA) was methylated with sodium isopropoxide and methyl iodide, and a crystalline oxime was obtained. Reduction with Zn dust gave what appeared to be 2-amino-3-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)butane hydrochloride, but there were sufficient uncertainties (possible dimethylation, only one oxime isolated, the need of strong reducing conditions) that the entire project was placed in, and still is in, an indefinite holding pattern. The similar analogues for DOM are the two Classic Ladies, DAPHNE and ELVIRA, and they, too, are for some time in the future.",

First, the synthesis was done by someone else and, as I have not been able to find where the notes are, this will be the one recipe in the footnote without explicit directions incorporated. The procedure used was exactly the same as that described for DMMDA, except that the starting material was dillapiole rather than apiole. The dillapiole was obtained by the careful fractionation of Oil of Dill (as opposed to the isolation of apiole from the careful fractionation of Oil of Parsley). Isomerization to isodillapiole, nitration with tetra-nitromethane to give 1-(2,3-dimethoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-nitropropene, and its reduction with LAH in ether to give 2,3-dimethoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyamphetamine hydrochloride (DMMDA-2) proceeded in a precisely analogous manner to the preparation of DMMDA.\n\nAnd the pharmacological part is rather thin as well. I was not the taster, and can only quote what I had been given. This same observer found a threshold at 28 milligrams. Under other circumstances, this comment on DMMDA-2 would have been tucked into the commentary on DMMDA where it belongs, but the activity level was called for in a large review article, and on the basis of the above, both its initials and the value of 5x the potency of mescaline were permanently enshrined in the published literature. What is it really like? I don't know. Its structure is an appealing amalgamation of that of MMDA and MMDA-2, and it might be quite a winner if the dosage and the duration were known.

The answer is that these are totally fascinating compounds just because they have no activity! By the way, in this instance, I actually made up most of the quotations. I am not sure that the subjects actually said, \"Nothing,\" but they did report that there were no effects. In my own experiments, my notes record the phrase, \"No effects whatsoever.\"\n\nA little background: one of the transmitter heavyweights in the brain is dopamine. Dopamine is called dopamine because it is an amine that comes from an amino acid that is 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and this, in German, is Di-Oxo-Phenyl-Alanine, or DOPA. The levo-optical (or L-) isomer of DOPA has rather cutely been called the punch-drunk Spanish matador, or El Dopa. But that is not part of the story.\n\nThe story is really about the \"Pink Spot of Schizophrenia.\" Many years ago, an observation was made in a biochemical laboratory on the East Coast that stirred up a rolling controversy. It had been found that if the urines of schizophrenic patients (sloppily called \"schizophrenic urines\") were extracted in such and such a way, and the extracts chromatographed, a pink spot would develop at a particular place on the chromatogram. Well, if this proved to be true with urines of a sick population, and were this proved to be different from the urines of a healthy population, it would constitute an objective diagnosis of schizophrenia. A simple chemical test to confirm a pathology that had defied all efforts to achieve consensus amongst the psychiatrists of the world.\n\nThe literature was suddenly filled with dozens of papers. Researcher A confirmed that the pink spot was found with schizophrenics, and not with normal controls. Researcher B found the pink spot in all urines, regardless of pathology. Researcher C found it in no urines at all. Researcher D argued that it was a factor from the hospital diet. Researcher E found that the pink spot reflected the time of day that the urine sample was collected. Researcher F drew a conclusion about where truth might lie by tallying the number of papers that supported argument A, B, C, D, or E.\n\nThe only confirmable fact that endured was that the pink spot was due to DMPEA. So a bright spotlight was directed towards its possible role in mental illness. And this expressed itself in the simple question: would it produce schizophrenia in a normal subject? No. And in a way I am comforted that that did not evolve into a simple litmus test for a schizophrenic diagnosis. There are so many cultural, political, and social factors that come to bear on the assignment of a diagnosis of mental illness, that I would have been forever skeptical of a neat biochemical marker.\n\nA chemical modification of DMPEA that has been explored in this question of pink spots, mental pathology, and diagnostic markers, is the corresponding acetamide. One of the metabolites of DMPEA was found to be the N-acetyl deriva-tive, N-acetyl-3,4- dimethoxyphenethylamine. It was found to be demethylated in man, and to have pharmacological activity in animals. Maybe this was the active compound that could be involved in the schizophrenic process. But human trials with it, as with the principal metabolite 3,4-dimethoxyphenylacetic acid, showed nothing at all in man.\n\nAnother chemical modification is the beta-hydroxy analogue of DMPEA. It has been explored separately, and is the subject of its own recipe, in its own rights. See DME.\n\nPink was not the only colorful spot associated with schizophrenia. Somewhere at about this same time, a research paper from Canada reported the observation of a mauve spot in the chromatographic analysis of urines of schizophrenic patients. This had nothing to do with DMPEA. I was working closely with a researcher at the psychiatric institute and we were fascinated by, again, a possible diagnostic marker. We assayed the urines of the next 10 patients being admitted as acute schizophrenics. No trace of mauve. We wrote to Canada, and verified the analytical procedure. We were told that the whatzis should have been added after, rather than before, the whosey, and that we should have heated for 30, not 10 minutes. Okay. We assayed the urines of the next 10 patients being admitted using these new directions. No trace of mauve. Another call to Canada, and we were informed that we still weren't doing it right. They were consistently batting a 100% positive correlation between mauve spots and schizophrenics, and 0% with healthy controls. In fact, they actually gave this positive test the name of a disease, Malvaria.\n\nThen, that little burst of insight! Aha! What if, just what if, they had been seeing something given to their schizophrenics? Chlorpromazine was the popular treatment of the day. We took a whopping dose of chlorpromazine, and over the next couple of days did manage (barely) to collect our urine samples. Both of us were positive Malvarians! And three days later, we were again negative. We were most likely seeing a metabolite of chlorpromazine. One last call to Canada with the ultimate question--had you given any medication to your schizophrenics before your urine analysis? Of course (came the answer)--it would not be ethical to leave them untreated. Another color down the drain, and still no objective measure for mental illness.\n\nBy the way, I cannot say I like the chlorpromazine trip. There is no real communication either with others or with yourself, with that stuff. You are a zombie, but if you are both schizophrenic and a zombie, you cannot possibly be troublesome for anybody in the emergency room.",

The process described above is just a bit bizarre (a sulfate salt extracting into methylene chloride) but it was the actual thing that was done. The work was started towards two additional compounds but these never got past the first \"ketone and phenol\" stage. p-Dimethoxybenzene was brought into reaction with n-caproic acid with polyphosphoric acid (aiming towards 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(n)-hexylamphetamine, DOHE) but this was dropped when DOAM proved to be down in potency. And the reaction between p-dimethoxybenzene and benzoyl chloride with anh. aluminum chloride went well (aiming towards 2,5-dimethoxy-4-benzylamphetamine, DOBZ). A goodly amount of the phenol (2-hydroxy-5-methoxybenzophenone) was obtained as fine yellow crystals, but this line of inquiry was also dropped.\n\nThe preparation of DOAM was, as a matter of fact, the last of the homol-ogous series of compounds actually completed, which stemmed from the original discovery of DOM. The \"Ten Classic Ladies\" concept was mentioned under ARIADNE, and the adding of a methyl group in the place of a hydrogen atom at the 4-position-methyl led to the synthesis of Ms. HECATE and gave rise to DOET. The whole series of methyl-ethyl-propyl-butyl-amyl compounds was appealing to me, in that the potency seemed to increase initially as the chain got longer, and then it abruptly dropped off. Wouldn't it be nice, I thought, if I could interest some pharmacologist in looking at this tight set of drugs with some animal model, to see if there is some neurotransmitter activity that would show a parallel action.\n\nI learned of a curious young researcher in Washington who had an elegant procedure for measuring serotonin agonist action using the (otherwise) discarded sheep umbilical artery strips. These become available each year at lambing time, do not cost the life of anything, and require very little compound. He assayed my compounds and, lo and behold, the serotonin activity also went through a maximum in the middle of this series. We published a short paper to this effect, which served as a excellent vehicle to get the cogent human data into the scientific literature.\n\nI have never understood the reasons that there might be connection between the twitching of a umbilical artery in a sheep and the appearance of an insight in the mind of man.

      "extensions_and_commentary": "The stars had clearly lined up in favor of making DOB and exploring its biological activity. This preparation had been completed in 1967 and the report of this compound and its unprecedently high potency published in 1971. And very shortly, two additional papers appeared completely independently. One described DOB made via a different route, and describing high activity in rats. The other described DOB and a couple of closely related brominated amphetamines and their action in man.\n\nThis is one of the last of the experimental compounds within the phenethylamine family on which any animal toxicity studies were performed by me prior to human studies. A mouse injected with 50 mg/Kg (ip) showed considerable twitching and was irritable. Another, at 100 mg/Kg (ip), had overt shaking at 20 minutes, which evolved into persistent hyperactivity that lasted several hours. Yet another, at 125 mg/Kg (ip), lost much of her righting reflex within 15 minutes, entered into convulsions at 50 minutes, and was dead a half hour later. A fourth mouse, at 150 mg/Kg (ip), entered into spontaneous convulsions within 10 minutes, and expired in what looked like an uncomfortable death at 22 minutes following injection. What was learned? That the LD/50 was somewhere between 100 and 125 mg/Kg for the mouse. And an effective dose in man of maybe 2 mg (for an 80 Kg man) is equivalent to 25 ug/Kg. Therefore the index of safety (the therapeutic index, the lethal dose divided by the effective dose) is well over a thousand. I feel that two mice were killed without anything of value having been received in return.\n\nActually, it is very likely that the damaging, if not lethal, level of DOB in man is a lot lower than this ratio would imply. There was a report of a death of a young lady following the snorting of an amount of DOB so massive, there was the actual recovery of over nine milligrams of the drug from her body tissues in the post-mortem examination. It was said that she and her companion had thought that the drug they were using was MDA and, taking a dosage appropriate for this, effectively overdosed themselves. He survived, following convulsions and an extended period (several weeks) of being in a comatose state. Tragic examples have been reported that involve arterial vascular spasm. But in most overdose cases ascribed to DOB, the identity of the drug has remained unestablished.\n\nAs with DOI, the presence of a heavy atom, the bromine atom, in DOB makes the radioactive isotope labelled material a powerful research tool. Studies with DOB labelled with either 82Br or 77Br have been used in human subjects to follow the distribution of the drug. The use of a whole body scanner permits the imaging of the intact body, with the travelings of the radioactivity easily followed from outside. A fascinating finding is that DOB goes first and foremost to the human lung where it accumulates for a couple of hours. It is only afterwards that the brain level builds up. There is a strong implication that some metabolic conversion occurs in the lung, and it is only after this that the truly active metabolite is available for central action. This is consistent with the relatively slow onset of effect, and the very long duration of action.\n\nAs with all the other psychedelics which can and have been studied as their optical isomers, it is the \"R\" isomer of DOB that is the more active than the racemic mixture, and the \"S\" is certainly much less active, but it has never been run up to fully active levels. The alpha-ethyl homologue of DOB is mentioned under ARIADNE. The positionally rearranged isomers of DOB are discussed under META-DOB.",

In general, the effects resemble stimulation more that anything else.\n\nA butyl group has four carbons, and they can be interconnected in four ways (as long as you don't connect them in rings). If all four of them are in a straight chain, you have the so-called normal butyl (or n-butyl) group, and this is the exact arrangement that is found in the DOBU. The atoms can be numbered #1 through #4, going outwards from the point of attachment. The chain can, however, be only three carbons long, and the fourth or extra carbon attached on the #2 carbon atom; this is called the iso-butyl (or i-butyl) group. Or the extra left-over carbon can be attached to the #1 carbon atom; this is called the secondary butyl (or sec-butyl or s-butyl) group. Or lastly, the atoms can be all scrunched up, with the chain only two carbons long, and the other two left-over methyl carbons attached to the #1 carbon atom. This isomer is called the tertiary butyl (or tert-butyl or t-butyl) group. In animal studies, and in preliminary human studies, the activity of these compounds drops as the butyl group gets more and more scrunched.\n\nThe isomer with the iso-butyl group has been synthesized by the Friedel- Crafts reaction of isobutyryl chloride with p-dimethoxybenzene, followed by reduction of the ketone to an alcohol, dehydration to a dimethylstyrene, and final hydrogenation to a hydrocarbon. The formation of the benzaldehyde, reaction with nitroethane, and final lithium aluminum hydride reduction to 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(2-methylpropyl)-amphetamine hydrochloride (DOIB, mp 164-166 °C) were completely conventional. In drug discrimination studies in rats, DOIB was only a third as active as DOM, and in humans the activity falls in the 10 to 15 milligram area. The isomer with the sec-butyl group was made in a somewhat similar manner, from 2,5-dimeth-oxyacetophenone. The addition of ethyl magnesium bromide gave an alcohol which with dehydration yielded a pair of dimethylstyrenes isomeric to the compound mentioned above. From there an identical sequence of steps (hydrogenation, benzaldehyde synthesis, nitrostyrene, and lithium aluminum hydride reduction) produced 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(1-methylpropyl)amphetamine hydrochloride (DOSB, mp 168-170 °C.). In the rat studies it was only a twelfth the potency of DOM, and in man the active dose is in the 25 to 30 milligram area. As with the normal butyl compound, there is a strong stimulation factor, with real and long-lasting sleep disturbance.\n\nThe last of the butyl isomers, the tert-butyl compound, was made from a much more obvious starting material. This is the commercially available tert-butyl hydroquinone. It was methylated in sodium hydroxide with methyl iodide, and then carried through the above sequence (benzaldehyde. mp 124 °C from cyclohexane, nitrostyrene, yellow crystals from methanol, mp 95-96.5 °C, and lithium aluminum hydride reduction) to give 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(1,1-dimethylethyl)amphetamine hydrochloride (DOTB, mp 168 °C). Rats trained in a process called the Sidman Avoidance Schedule gave behavior that suggested that DOTB had no activity at all, and in human trials, doses of up to 25 milligrams were totally without effect.\n\nAn effort was made to prepare a butyl analogue containing a ring, but it was never completed. This was the cyclopropylmethyl isomer, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-cyclo-propylmethylamphetamine hydrochloride, DOCPM. Only the first step of its synthesis was complete (the reaction of cyclopropylcarboxylic acid chloride with p-dimethoxybenzene) and even it went badly. The desired ketone (2,5-dimethoxyphenyl cyclopropyl ketone) was most difficult to separate from the recovered starting ether. A promising approach would be the isolation of the phenol (2-hydroxy-5-methoxyphenyl cyclopropyl ketone) which is a beautiful yellow solid with a melting point of 99-100 °C from methanol. Anal. (C11H12O3) C,H. It then could be methylated to the wanted intermediate. It is the major product when the reaction is conducted with anhydrous aluminum chloride in methylene chloride.\n\nThe 2-carbon phenethylamine homologues of these compounds could all, in principle be easily made by using nitromethane instead of nitroethane with the intermediary benzaldehydes. But, as of the present time, none of them have been made, so their pharmacology remains completely unknown.",

DOC is clearly a long-lasting, dyed-in-the-wool psychedelic.\n\nIn the making of this, by the procedures that have been followed in Canada, there are two chemical intermediates which might, some day, be looked at as potential psychedelics under their own colors. Reduction of the compound that is called DON in this Book II (2,5-dimethoxy-4-nitroamphetamine hydrochloride) with Pd/charcoal and hydrogen, gives the 4-amino derivative. This is 2,5-dimethoxy-4-aminoamphetamine dihydrochloride, DOA, which melts at 248-250 °C. And the reduction of an oxime intermediate gives rise to the acetamido analogue, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-acetamidoamphetamine hydrochloride, DOAA, with a mp of 249-250 °C. Neither compound has been tasted, but someday this omission will be corrected. DOA and DOAA have a sinister ring to them, however, and some changes of terminology might be needed. DOA, in the coroner's vocabulary, means Dead-On-Arrival. But then, AMA (the American Medical Association) just happens to also mean (in the jargon of emergency medicine) Against-Medical-Advice. Everything averages out, somehow. Remember that the amyl homolog (amyl at the 4-position) follows the 4-letter convention of all of the DOM homo-logues, and has the code name of DOAM. Thus, DOA, amino; DOAA, acetamido, and DOAM, amyl.\n\nOne must learn to keep one's sense of humor.

It wasn't the sort of thing that someone would just happen to do. If there were a rationale, then that's fine. But by capricious impulse, no. But there is a rationale of sorts, which I just hinted at in the discussion under 2C-T-21.\n\nThis argument of reason goes as follows. Assume that I would like to put a fluorine atom into a drug that does not normally have one. Why would I want to? Because I want to have the molecule carry a radioactive fluorine atom into some inner recess of the brain. Why? Because by using a positron-emitting fluorine I could possibly visualize the area of the brain that the drug went to. And if it went there in some abnormal way, the exact measure of that abnormality might give some clue as to potential brain misfunctioning.\n\nBut, if you put a fluorine atom on a drug, it becomes a totally new drug and, quite reasonably, a pharmacologically different drug. However, a body of evidence is being accumulated that if a halogen, such as a bromine or an iodine atom, is replaced by a beta-fluoroethyl group, the electronic and polar properties of the drug can be pretty much the same. So, what psychedelics have a bromo or an iodo group? Obviously, DOB and DOI. Thus, DOEF is a natural candidate for fluorine-18 positron emission tomography, and also a natural candidate for clinical trials. And, voila, it is an active material.\n\nAnd I'll bet you dollars to doughnuts, that if one were to make the two-carbon analog 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(2-fluoroethyl)-phenethylamine, it would be every bit as much a treasure and ally as is 2C-B or 2C-I. In fact, I am sure enough about this prediction that I am willing to name the stuff 2C-EF. It will be easily made from 2C-B by the same reaction scheme that was used above for DOEF.

And the putting of the ethyl thence should be DOE. This was fine until it was pointed out to me by a close colleague that DOE was a classic abbreviation for desoxyephedrine, a synonym for methamphetamine. The pressure to add the RTS of the RETS of the ethyl was heightened by looking ahead to other members of the series. DOA became DOAM, DOE became DOET, but DOM was already too firmly set in popular usage. And, anyway, DOME really looked strange.\n\nThe original publications of the action of DOM clearly documented the compound as being a psychedelic and one with a sizeable measure of potential abuse. And, it is not a surprise that it was quickly shuffled into a legal classification that effectively precluded any further study of it. So, when this immediate homologue of DOM was studied and discussed in the literature, all reported dosages were those that were at the lowest levels, and no disturbing hints of abusability were mentioned. And this particular homologue has so far escaped the attention and restrictive action of the drug enforcement agencies, although the specific wording of the Controlled Substance Analogue Enforcement Act of 1986 might make this point moot, at least as far as human trials are concerned. At modest levels, DOET has the reputation of being a cognitive enhancer and is largely free of those sensory distortions that would catch the attention of the authorities who cannot tolerate drugs that distort the senses. The higher levels mentioned here have never been put into the published literature. It must be noted that there is a considerable variation of individual responses to this material. The effective dose range stated is quite broad. Some people are quite sensitive. This is, after all, one of the Classic Ladies, namely HECATE.\n\nThe young experimental subject who had the dramatic relief from menstrual cramps at the one milligram dose tried the compound again the following month, and again had complete relief. But another volunteer, also plagued with severe cramping at that particular time of month, found no relief at all. A 50% success rate.

      "extensions_and_commentary": "Again, as with every other psychedelic amphetamine analogue which has a chiral center and has been explored as the individual optical isomers, it is the \"R\" isomer that is the more potent. And again, the other isomer, the \"S\" isomer, still shows some activity. The same was true with DOB, and DOM, and MDA. The only exception was MDMA, but then that is more of a stimulant, and there is virtually no psychedelic component to its action. Rat studies, where there is a measure of the discrimination of a test compound from saline, have shown the \"R\" isomer to have about twice the potency of the \"S\" isomer. That the \"R\" is more potent is certain, but the above reports would suggest that the factor would be closer to times-four rather than times-two.\n\nA number of studies with DOI in animal models have shown it to have an extremely high binding capacity to what are called the 5-HT2 receptors. Serotonin is a vital neurotransmitter in the brain, and is strongly implicated in the action of all of the phenethylamine psychedelics. The place where it acts, at the molecular level, is called its receptor site. As an outgrowth of the cooperative studies of the medicinal chemists working closely with the neuropharmacologists, a number of compounds have emerged that interact with these sites. But this one interacts with these sites and not those, and that one interacts with those sites and not these. So, there has developed a collection of sub-divisions and sub-subdivisions of receptor sites, all related to serotonin, but each defined by the particular compound that interacts most tightly with it.\n\nThus, there were serotonin \"1\" receptors, and then there were \"1\" and \"2\" receptors, and then \"1a\" and \"1b\" and \"2a\" and \"2b\" receptors, and on and on. These are called 5-HT receptors, since the chemical name for serotonin is 5-hydroxytryptamine, and the scientist would never want to let the layman know just what he is talking about. DOI has been synthesized with a variety of radioactive iodine isotopes in it, and these tools have been of considerable value in mapping out its brain distribution. And by extrapolation, the possible localization of other psychedelic compounds that cannot be so easily labelled. A small neurochemical research company on the East Coast picked up on these properties of DOI, and offered it as a commercial item for research experiments. But I doubt that they are completely innocent of the fact that DOI is an extremely potent psychedelic and that it is still unrecognized by the Federal drug laws since, in their most recent catalog, the price had almost doubled and a note had been added to the effect that telephone orders cannot be accepted for this compound.\n\nThe four-carbon butylamine homologue (the ARIADNE analogue) of DOI has been synthesized. A mixture of the free base of 1-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminobutane (see preparation under DOB) and phthalic anhydride was fused, cooled, and recrystallized from either methanol or cyclohexane to give crystals of N-[1-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-butyl]phthalimide with a melting point of 76-77 °C and an analysis (C20H21NO4) C,H,N. This was iodinated with iodine monochloride in acetic acid to give N-[1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-butyl]phthalimide which was chromatographically distinct from the uniodinated starting material (silica gel, CH2Cl2 ), but which did not crystallize. This was treated with hydrazine hydrate in ethanol to provide 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminobutane hydrochloride which was crystallized from CH3CN/EtOH to give white crystals with a mp of 217-218.5 °C and an analysis (C12H19CINO2) C,H,N. This butyl homolog of DOI has been assayed at up to four milligrams, and is without any central effects whatsoever. An experiment with 12.4 microcuries of 131I labelled material with the whole body scanner showed most of it accumulating in the gut and liver, with almost none to the brain.\n\nFor those who find such statistics interesting, the parent compound DOI vies with DOB as probably the most potent of the phenethylamine psychedelics as of the moment, and certainly one of the most long lived.\n\nA very important, centrally pivotal, and completely paradoxical compound in this area, is the N,N-dimethyl homologue of DOI, or 2,5-dimethoxy-N,N-dimethyl-4-iodoamphetamine (IDNNA). This compound was the starting point of the study of a large number of homologues and it deserves, and has received, a separate recipe.",

      "extensions_and_commentary": "The rationale for the design and making of DOM has already been discussed. One could predict that it could have been, theoretically, a totally inactive compound and maybe an effective blocker for whatever receptor sites are being occupied by other psychoactive drugs and even for strange things that some unbalanced people might actually make within their bodies, using their own personal chemistry. On the other hand, it could have been a potent psychedelic in its own rights, and if so, probably long lived. The latter \"could have been\" proved to be so.\n\nThe very modest amount of study of the individual optical isomers clearly indicates that the \"R\" isomer is the more active. The sparse comments suggest that some of the heavier physical aspects of the racemate might be due to contributions from the \"inactive\" \"S\" isomer. It is, after all, the \"S\" isomer of amphetamine that carries the major punch of that stimulant. Maybe if that isomer were removed, and one were to explore the pure \"R\" isomer of DOM, the dramatic visual aspects of the larger dosages might not be complicated with a troublesome physical component.\n\nThis compound, unbeknownst to me, was scattered widely and plentifully in the heyday of the Haight-Ashbury in San Francisco, in mid-1967. It was distributed under the name STP, which was said to stand for Serenity, Tranquility, and Peace. It was also claimed to represent Super Terrific Psychedelic, or Stop The Police. The police called it: Too Stupid to Puke. Actually, the name was taken from the initials of a motor additive which was completely unrelated chemically. Incredibly, and sadly, one of the avowed experts in the area of the \"sensuous drugs\" actually stated that STP, the motor oil additive, was really one and the same as STP, the highly dangerous psychedelic. The motor oil additive, he wrote in a book of his, had properties somewhat related to those of LSD, mescaline, and the amphetamines. How fortunate that the love children of the time didn't do much reading, for they might have gotten into yet deeper pharmacological troubles with drug raids on the local gasoline stations.\n\nTwo complications became apparent during this first appearance and they led to serious difficulties. One, there was no equation made between STP and DOM. No one knew what this drug was which had been distributed in a cavalier way throughout the city. There could be no educated guess as to the best treatment of overdose emergencies. And secondly, the initial tablets that had been distributed apparently contained 20 milligrams of DOM per tablet; later, it was dropped to 10 milligrams. Either of these, in retrospect, is now known to be a thoroughly whopping dose. The overdose situation was aggravated by the slow onset of DOM. The user may be aware of some initial effects at the half-hour point, there will be what might be called a + or ++ at the end of the first hour, and the full impact of the drug is not appreciated until some two hours have elapsed. But many of the recipients of the free handouts of DOM were familiar with LSD which can show its alert in 15 to 20 minutes, or even sooner with a large dose, and there is already a deep and compelling intoxication felt at the half-hour point. They, quite reasonably, expected this familiar activity pattern with STP and assumed, when there was little if any activity noted at the half-hour point, that the potency was less than expected. They took one or even two additional dosage units. Thus, some of the overdose victims of that period may well have taken as much as 30 mg of DOM. The slow onset of action, coupled with the remarkably long duration, caught many innocent users unprepared.\n\nClinical studies have documented the rapid tolerance development from repeated exposures to DOM. Five volunteers were given 6 milligrams daily for three days. Objectively, psychological tests showed a decrease in responses. Subjectively, all found extremely intense effects on the first day, and all but one found it unpleasant. By the third exposure on the third day, all had diminished responses, ranging from only \"moderately strong\" to \"felt absolutely nothing.\" One actually slept during the experience on the third day.\n\nThe hexadeutero-analogue (deuterium atoms on the two methoxyl groups) has been prepared as an internal standard for analytical work, but there are no reports of its human pharmacology. A study with this sort of derivative would be a fine companion to the studies already underway with the mescaline analogues that are similarly substituted. A difference exists, however. With mescaline, it is believed that the loss of a methoxyl group is a step towards the inactivation of the compound, whereas with DOM this loss may be associated with the formation of an active metabolite. The several fascinating questions raised by possible differences in both the rates and the degree of demethylation of these two compounds are well worth trying to answer.\n\nA number of compounds related to DOM had been synthesized and studied at the University of California at San Francisco, at about this time. Two of these were simply the juggling of the two methoxyl groups and the methyl group on the ring, still maintaining the 2,4,5-ness relative to the amphetamine chain. These are 2,4-dimethoxy-5-methylamphetamine and 4,5-dimethoxy-2-methylamphetamine. Since the slang name for DOM in and about the medical center was STP, and since STP was the name of a motor oil additive, it is not unreasonable that the first of these to be synthesized, the 2,4-dimethoxy-5-methyl isomer, was referred to by the name of another motor oil additive popular at that time, F-310. The Vilsmeier reaction between 2,4-dimethoxytoluene and the Vilsmeier complex of POCl3 and N-methylformanilide gave the benzaldehyde (mp 117-118 °C) with a yellow malononitrile derivative from EtOH with a mp of 193-194 °C. The nitrostyrene from this and nitroethane formed yellow crystals from CH3CN, with a mp 138-139 °C. The amine formed easily with LAH in ether, and the product F-310 (or 5-DOM) gave white crystals from CH3CN with a mp of 182-183 °C.\n\nAnd the other isomer, the 4,5-dimethoxy-2-methyl counterpart, became known familiarly as F-320, or sometimes simply 2-DOM. Its preparation followed an identical procedure, starting from 3,4-dimethoxytoluene. I have been told that F-310 is not active even at 20 milligrams in man, which would make it several times less potent than DOM (STP). I know of no trials with F-320. The use of the letter RFS does not imply any relationship between these two compounds and the series described elsewhere with the RFS code followed by other numbers, such as F-2 and F-22. These latter are F's because they are furans, not motor oil additives. And yet another oil additive, well known at the time as Z-7, became associated with the synthesis of the DOM (STP) isomer with its groups in the 2,4,6-positions. This is entered separately under gamma-DOM.",

      "extensions_and_commentary": "I can't remember the exact names of the companies that went with the oil additives. STP was, I believe, it's own thing, and originally stood for Scientifically Treated Petroleum. And F-310 was, I believe, a Chevron Oil product. F-320 was, of course, the product of the wild and happy chemists at the Pharmaceutical Chemistry Department at the University of California in San Francisco, playing with what they fondly called \"funny drugs.\" And when the 2,4,6-orientation became an obvious positional isomer, the Pennzoil Oil Company's additive, Z-7, was a natural to have its name volunteered to the cause. There was one additional isomer possible, with the methyl in the 2-position and the methoxyl groups at the 4- and 6-positions. This followed the more conventional aldehyde made from 3,5-dimethoxytoluene via the Vilsmeier process, with POCl3 and N-methylformanilide. This material (2,4-dimethoxy-6-methylbenzaldehyde with mp 64-65 °C from cyclohexane or from MeOH) is completely distinct from the isomer used above (2,6-dimethoxy-4-methylbenzaldehyde with a mp of 92-93 °C from MeOH). The amphetamine from this isomer is 2,4-dimethoxy-6-methylamphetamine, and had been christened by the chemistry crowd as Z-7.1.\n\nMuch effort had been put forth in research by this medical school group of graduate students and graduate advisors, to try to explain the biological activity of the 2,4,5-things such as TMA-2 and DOM (STP). And a considerable investment had been made in the attempt to tie together the amphetamine world of psychedelics with the indole world of psychedelics. The convenience of having two methoxy groups para to one another was a clear invitation to speculate upon the formation of a benzoquinone intermediate of some kind, and this would require the loss of the methyl groups which were already known to be metabolically labile. This \"quinone-like\" intermediate was the cornerstone of a \"hydroquinone hypothesis,\" as it allowed further condensation within the molecule itself involving the primary amine group, to form something called an indolene which, with some arcane electron pushing and removal, could eventually become an indole. There. We now have a tie-in to the tryptamine world, and to serotonin, and that entire neurotransmitter magic.\n\nThere was only one small fly in the ointment. No matter how the 2,4,5-things were explained, none of the proposed mechanisms could allow for the 2,4,6-things to also be active.\n\nHow can one accommodate such blasphemy? The first and obvious approach was the simplest. Denial. The 2,4,6-things aren't really active at all. Placebo stuff. There is a commonly used phrase, \"bad science\" which is an in-famous term used to belittle findings that do not fit with one's theories or purposes. But that simply didn't wash, because I knew, as did a few others who chose not to identify themselves too publicly, that TMA-2 and TMA-6 were both fully active in the 40 to 50 milligram area. And although not as potent as DOM, the compound of this recipe, psi-DOM or Z-7, was certainly an active one. So, since approach number one didn't work, try approach number two. Make the shoe fit the wearer, without respect to the size of his foot. One single size shoe fits all. One single mechanistic hypothesis explains all. It was obvious that for the \"hydroquinone\" hypothesis to survive, Z-7 would have to undergo some metabolic oxidation--phenol formation--in the 3-position.\n\nAnd guess who was actually euchred into embarking onto the synthesis of this hypothetical metabolic Lucy [that's the anthropological-type, not the LSD-type Lucy]? Moi! On to a new methoxylated amphetamine which would be called Z-7.2. Oxidation of the above 2,4-dimethoxy-6-methylbenzaldehyde with metachloroperoxybenzoic acid gave 2,4-dimethoxy-6-methylphenol which smoothly methylated (KOH, CH3I) to give 2,3,5-trimethoxytoluene as a white oil, bp 59-62 °C at 0.1 mm/Hg. This formed the anion between the meta-methoxy groups with butyllithium, and N-methylformanilide gave the new compound 2,3,6-trimethoxy-4-methylbenzaldehyde, also an oil (bp 130-140 °C at 0.7 mm/Hg) with an excellent NMR spectrum. This formed the 3-carbon nitrostyrene with nitroethane, as bright yellow crystals from methanol with a mp 67-68.5 °C (and excellent NMR and microanalysis, C,H,N). Lithium aluminum hydride reduction gave rise to what I was assuming would be the target amphetamine, 4-methyl-2,3,6-trimethoxyamphetamine or Z-7.2. This formed a hydrochloride salt which, although analytically excellent, insisted in remaining as an ether and chloroform-soluble oil which had an excellent NMR spectrum. This was certainly MY target compound, but it was not THEIR target compound. The upper echelons who were running the show were serious about this hydroquinone thing. Therefore, this product Z-7.2, that should have been entered into human evaluation, was instead processed further by the substitution of a t-BOC on the amine group, oxidation to the quinone with ceric ammonium nitrate, reduction to the hydroquinone with dithionite, and finally deprotection of the blocking t-BOC group by hydrochloric acid. The final product, 2,5-dihydroxy-6-methoxy-4-methylamphetamine hydrochloride, was an extremely light-sensitive solid which was looked at by NMR (excellent spectrum in D2O) and by cyclic voltimetry (destructive and uninformative) but which would have been totally worthless to have tasted.\n\nIn fact, the whole 2,4,6 substitution concept is just now beginning to explode. Fully half of the drugs described in this Book II are of the classical 2,4,5-trisubstitution pattern, and it is becoming evident that every one of them will have a 2,4,6-trisubstituted counterpart that bids fair to be an active psychedelic. Diligence could thus easily double the number of known psychedelics. The nickname \"pseudo\" is really the Greek letter \"psi\" which looks like a candelabrum standing on the table holding up three candles. If I can find the type in some font, I will simply precede each known drug with this letter, to indicate that the 2,4,5-ness has become a 2,4,6-ness. Therefore, Z-7 is also pseudo-DOM.\n\nZ-7.2 might have been an interesting compound to taste. But the academic climate was not appropriate at that time (early 1977) for such honesty. The \"hydro-quinone hypothesis\" is now not much more than a minor bit of history. And anyhow, it was just about this time that I had uncovered a slick way of getting a sulfur atom into the amphetamine molecule. I quickly lost interest in the pursuit of other people's hypotheses that didn't seem to lead anywhere. Maybe, someday, some single earth-shaking mechanism will emerge to explain everything. But in the meantime, the best contribution I can make to this \"grand unified theory of psychedelic activity\" is to continue to make new and unexpected things which, if they are active, will effectively destroy any hypothesis that just happens to be popular at the moment. It is a lot more exciting, too.",

      "extensions_and_commentary": "There is a thread of disconnection and of inconsistent reference that pervades most of the reports that I have received concerning the use of DOPR. The word that comes to mind is hypnogogic. There is a drifting into that place that lies between a not-quite-awake and a not-quite-asleep state seems to characterize this compound. There is no question but that it is very potent, and that it is very long-lived. But there is a nagging suggestion of the out-of-body, out-of-center character that is the hallmark of the anesthetic and delusional drugs such as scopolamine or ketamine. With them, the psychedelic effects become clouded with touches of amnesia. If DOPR shows this with it's three carbon alkyl group, thereis every reason to pay close attention as the chain becomes longer.\n\nThere had been quite a bit of speculation in the literature that the metabolic attack on DOM was at the 4-position, and this was an oxidation process. In a moment of inspiration, I decided to explore a similar oxidation step in DOPR, since it is probably the most potent of the DO-series. Why not make the compound which would be the first step in this oxidation, the 1-hydroxypropyl analogue? This I did, by using the phthalimide derivative of 2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine (described in the synthesis of DOI) and making the propiophenone using propionic acid as both reagent and solvent, and polyphosphoric acid as the condensing agent. The ketone product (a white crystalline solid from methanol) was dissolved in warm methanol and reduced to the alcohol with sodium borohydride. This product, also a white crystalline solid, was stripped of the phthalimide blocking group with overnight refluxing with hydrazine in ethanol. The product, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(1-hydroxypropyl)-amphetamine (hydroxy-DOPR) had a mp of 148-150 °C from IPA. Its activity is not yet known, but there were no effects at all at trials, orally, of up to 200 micrograms.\n\nBut this is all with the normal-propyl compound. There is a rich collection of misinformation and potential discovery that is associated with the isopropyl isomer. This structural isomer, 2,5-dimethoxyl-4-(i)-propylamphetamine is properly called DOIP for des-oxy-iso-propyl. It has been synthesized and explored in animals and, to a modest extent, in man. The synthesis has proceeded from 2,5-dimethoxyacetophenone by the addition of a methyl group to the carbonyl followed by reduction to the hydrocarbon. Aldehyde formation, nitropropene synthesis with nitroethane, and lithium aluminum hydride reduction are uneventful, providing the hydrochloride salt DOIP, which has a mp of 183-184 °C as an analytical sample. Animal tests (such as rabbit hyperthermia assays), have indicated that the isopropyl compound DOIP is less potent than the propyl prototype, DOPR, by between one and two orders of magnitude. In man, a dose of four milligrams, a rousing dose of DOPR, is without any effects. At 10 milligrams, there is some disturbance but substantially no effects. I have been told that with doses in the 20 to 30 milligram range there are valid changes in mental state, but I have not been told the nature of these changes.\n\nA fascinating red herring had been drawn across all of these exacting lines by a strange visitor to this research project. An olive-faced M.D., Ph.D., passed through this confusing scene briefly, and when he left, a small supply of DOPR left with him. He promptly published in an obscure journal some animal behavioral responses which he ascribed to the isopropyl analogue, DOIP. But what he had studied could only have been DOPR since DOIP, at that time, had not yet been synthesized either by me, or by either of the other two active synthesists of that moment. It was not yet a known material. We all made it some time later, but by that time our olive-face had disappeared. There is a magnificent French phrase that applies here as nowhere else; Il a foutu le camp. Its idiomatic meaning is equivalent to our, \"He took off,\" or \"He split the scene,\" but the literal translation is, \"He fucked the camp.\"",

A gradual decline brings the subject back to a restful baseline somewhere before the 12th hour. The following day is often seen as one of tiredness and low energy. An anonymous flyer appeared in the California drug community in 1984 stating an effective range to be 50 to 100 milligrams, but it described the drug as the sulfate. The above data all pertain to the hydrochloride salt.\n\nThe replacement of that one methyl group with an ethyl group leads to a nice jeu de mots. The play on words depends on a remarkable coincidence. The name of the alkaloid mescaline stems from an ancient Nahuatl word for a drink (Mexcalli) which also provided the source of the term Mescal (an Agave of entirely different pharmacology). The prefix for the simplest, the one carbon organic radical, is methyl. This is from the Greek word \"methy\" and represents wine from wood. Such is, indeed, methyl alcohol, or methanol, or wood alcohol, the simplest one-carbon drink and a rather dangerous one for the human animal. And this is the group that is on the central oxygen of mescaline.\n\nIt is customary to refer to homologs (bigger-by-one) of methanol by their classical chemical names, so the natural extension of methyl is ethyl, and that of mescaline would be escaline. One carbon-chain on the 4-position oxygen becoming a two-carbon chain. This is all entymologically appealing, but there is no botanical support for any of it. The ethyl group is much more rare in nature. It is just a happy coincidence that mescaline (the plant), and methyl (the alkyl group involved), and methoxy (the group on the 4-position of the aromatic ring) all happen to start with the letter RMS.\n\nVery few of the homomescaline phenethylamines have been synthesized as their three-carbon chain counterparts, the corresponding analogues of amphetamine. And only three of them have been explored in man (four, if you count the amphetamine analogue of mescaline itself, TMA). The obvious names for these compounds have, unfortunately, already been used. It would be logical to use the letter M for a methoxy, and the letter E for ethoxy, etc. and simply read the groups from around the ring. But this is the naming system for the 2,4,5-trisubstituted amphetamines. MEM is, for example, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethoxyamphetamine (in sequence, methoxy, ethoxy, methoxy reading around the ring, and a fascinating compound talked about at length in this book), so this term cannot represent 3,5-dimethoxy-4-ethoxyamphetamine.\n\nA truly simple code employs the length of the carbon chain. The phenethylamine chain is two carbons long, and the amphetamine chain is three carbons long.\n\nIf a drug has been initially developed (and initially named) as an amphetamine derivative (three carbon chain) then the two-carbon chain analogue will use the original name (or a symbolic part of it) with the term 2C ahead of it. The two-carbon analogue of DOB (a three-carbon chain compound) will become 2C-B. DOI becomes 2C-I, DON becomes 2C-N, and DOET becomes 2C-E. Each of these is a substituted amphetamine derivative lacking one carbon atom, thus becoming a phenethylamine derivative. Most of these have 2,4,5-substitution patterns.\n\nAnd if a drug has been initially developed (and initially named) as a phenethylamine derivative (two carbon chain) then the three-carbon chain analogue will use the original name with the term 3C ahead of it. The three carbon analogue of E (escaline, a two-carbon chain compound) will become 3C-E. P becomes 3C-P and CPM becomes 3C-CPM. Most of these have 3,4,5-substitution patterns.\n\nThus, R2-CS implies that a known amphetamine drug has been shortened to a phenethylamine, and R3-CS inplies that a known phenethylamine has been lengthened to an amphetamine. A great number of the former have been made and have proven to be most rewarding. Only a few of the latter are known, but most of them will eventually prove to be potent psychedelics.",

It is one of the world's most remarkable coincidences that after the second synthesis of MDOH, when MDOH had really and truly been actually prepared, the brand new search for proper dosage and characterization of effects revealed that they were almost identical to the earlier observations for (the inadvertently produced) MDA.\n\nThis reminds me of my speculations in the discussion of both FLEA and the HOT compound where they also showed paired molecular structures with their prototypes that differ only by a single oxygen atom. Again, might there be some metabolic interconversion within the body? The immediate thought would be that the oxygen atom (the hydroxy group) might be metabolically removed, and the effects of either drug are due to the action of MDA. But the opposite direction is in many ways more appealing, the in vivo conversion of MDA to MDOH. Why more appealing? For one thing, oxidative changes are much more common in the body than reductive changes. For another, the conversion of amphetamine to N-hydroxyamphetamine is an intermediate in the conversion of amphetamine to phenylacetone, a known metabolic process in several animal species. And that intermediate, N-hydroxyamphetamine, is a material that gives the famous cytochrome P-450 complex that has fascinated biochemists studying the so-called NADPH-dependent metabolism.\n\nI would put my money on the likelihood of MDA going to MDOH if it should turn out that the two drugs interconvert in the body. And in that case, it would be MDOH, or another metabolite on down the line that is common to both MDA and MDOH, that is the factor intrinsic to the intoxication that is produced.

So why is this drug not active? The usual reason advanced by the pharmacologists is that the body is full of potent enzymes known as monoamine oxidases, and this is a monoamine, and so the body simply chews away on it in an oxidative manner, inactivating it before it ever makes it to some target receptor.\n\nThat is the pitch given in the textbooks. Phenethylamines are subject to easy enzymatic oxidation, hence they are not active. The presence of an alpha-methyl group (the corresponding amphetamines) blocks the compound from easy access to the enzyme, and since that protects them from oxidative destruction, they are active. The oft-quoted exception is mescaline, and even it is largely destroyed, as evidenced by the large amount needed for activity (a fraction of a gram). Sorry, I can't buy it. This entire book is peppered with phenethylamines that are active at the few-milligram area. Why aren't they also destroyed as well? The textbooks simply are not right.\n\nMDPEA was one of the seven compounds evaluated as to toxicity and animal behavior at the University of Michigan under contract from the Army Chemical Center. Its Edgewood Arsenal code number was EA-1297. The number for MDA itself was EA-1298.\n\nThe beta-hydroxy analogue of MDPEA is the ethanolamine MDE, standing for methylenedioxyethanolamine. This is an old term, and in the more recent literature, since 1975 certainly, MDE has been used to represent methylenedioxyethylamphetamine. The ethanolamine compound is discussed in the recipe for DME.\n\nThere is a family of compounds, to be discussed elsewhere, that is called the Muni-Metro (see under METHYL-J). The simplest member is this compound, MDPEA, and under its chemically acceptable synonym, homopiperonylamine, it can be called RHS. Following that code, then, the N-methyl homologue of MDPEA is METHYL-H, and it has been looked at, clinically, as an antitussive agent. N-METHYL-MDPEA, or METHYL-H, or N-methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyphenethylamine is effective in this role at dosages of about 30 milligrams, but I have read nothing that would suggest that there were any central effects.

Certainly the extrapolations involve many what-if's and maybe's. The path can be humorous, it certainly can be tortuous, and it often calls for special things such as faith, insight, and intuition. But can one say that it is logical?\n\nLogic is a tricky thing to evaluate. One of the earliest approaches was laid down by Aristotle, in the form of the syllogism. In it there are three lines consisting of two premises and a conclusion, a form that is called a 'mood.' All are statements of relationships and, if the premises are true, there are only certain conclusions that may logically follow. For example: Every man is a lover. Every chemist is a man. Therefore, every chemist is a lover. Letting lover be the major term 'a' and letting chemist be the minor term 'b' and letting man be the middle term 'm', this reduces to: Every m is a, Every b is m. Therefore, every b is a - and it is a valid mood called Barbara.\n\nOf the 256 possible combinations of all's and some's and none's and are's and are-not's, only 24 moods are valid. The reasoning here with MDPH goes: Some stimulants when given a methylenedioxy ring are MDMA-like. Some ring-unsubstituted 1,1-dimethylphenylethylamines are stimulants. Therefore, some ring-unsubstituted 1,1-dimethylphenylethylamines when given a methylenedioxy ring are MDMA-like. In symbolic form this is: Some m is a, and Some b is m, then Some b is a - and this is not one of the 24 valid moods.\n\nGiven the first premise as some m is a, there is only one valid syllogism form that can follow, and this is known as Disamis. The conclusion is the same. But the second premise is false so the entire reasoning is illogical. What is the false second premise? It is not a fact that every stimulant is a phentermine. There are lots of stimulants that are not phentermines. So much for applying syllogistics to pharmacology.",

The LSD overwhelmed the residual numbing of the MDMA, and the generated state was overwhelmingly erotic and out of body.\n\nThere can be no way of analytically organizing such a gemisch of drug-drug interactions with any logic that would allow a definitive interpretation.

Having found the activity of MMDA, the 'scientific' thing to do would be to compare it against the other 'psychotomimetic' amphetamine that was known at that time (this was 1962), namely TMA. Comparing their structures, the only difference of any kind was that two of the adjacent methoxyl groups of TMA were replaced with a 5-membered ring, called the methylenedioxy ring.\n\nWhere does one go next? Some perverse inspiration suggested increasing the size of this ring to a 6-membered ring, the ethylenedioxy (or dioxene) homologue. Well, if you thought that getting myristicinaldehyde was a difficulty, it was nothing compared to getting this 6-membered counterpart. But I huffed and I puffed, and I did make enough to taste and to evaluate. And it was here that I got the divine message! No activity!! So, rather than being condemned forever a la Sisyphus to push ever larger rings up my psyche, I gave myself permission to pursue another path. The message was: 'Don't change the groups. Leave them as they are, but relocate them instead.' And that led directly to TMA-2 and its story.\n\nA couple of diversions may be mentioned here. Before the blessed inactivity of MEDA was established, the 7-membered ring counterpart, 3-methoxy-4,5-trimethylenedioxyamphetamine (MTMA) was prepared by essentially the same procedure. The above 3-methoxy-4,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde with trimethylene bromide gave 3-methoxy-4,5-trimethylenedioxybenzaldehyde, white solids, with a malononitrile derivative with a mp of 134-135 C; the aldehyde with nitroethane gave the nitropropene with a mp of 86-87 C; and this with LAH gave MTDA as the hydrochloride (mp 160-161 C) again isolated first as the picrate. It had been tasted at up to an 8 milligram dosage (no activity, but none expected) before being abandoned.\n\nAnd, an initial effort was made to synthesize a five-member ring (methylenedioxy) with a methyl sticking out from it. This ethylidine homologue got as far as the aldehyde stage. The reaction between 3,4-dihydroxy-5-methoxybenzaldehyde and 1,1-dibromoethane in acetone containing anhydrous potassium carbonate gave a minuscule amount of a product that was a two-component mixture. This was resolved by dozens of separate injections into a preparatory gas chromatography system, allowing the isolation of the second of the two components in a quantity sufficient to demonstrate (by NMR spectroscopy) that it was the desired 3-methoxy-4,5-ethylidinedioxybenzaldehyde. Starting with the pre-prepared dipotassium salt or the lead salt of the catecholaldehyde gave nothing. With no activity being found with MEDA, all was abandoned.\n\nThere are some comments made under MDA for successful chemistry (using a different approach) along these lines when there is no methoxyl group present. These are the compounds EDA and IDA. But the pharmacology was still not that exciting.",

But if one were to look at the effects of putting an ethoxy group onto TMA-2 in place of a methoxy group as a way of decreasing the effectiveness, then the 4-position becomes the worst position (MEM is equipotent to TMA-2), and the 5-position is perhaps a little less bad (MME is almost as potent) and the 2-position is the best by far (EMM is out of it, potency-wise).\n\nIn other words, in the comparison of the 2- and the 5-positions, the lengthening of the 5-position gives modest loss of activity, and the lengthening of the whatever in the 2-position is the most disruptive. With this as a basis for prediction, then MEE (which differs from MEM only by a lengthening of the 5-position substituent) might be only a little less active than MEM and, as MEM is about the same as TMA-2, it is distinctly possible that MEE may show activity in the area at dosages that are not much above the 25 to 50 milligram area.

The completion of all the possible trimethoxyamphetamines (the TMA's) showed that only two of them combined the values of dependability of positive psychedelic effects with a reasonably high potency. Both TMA-2 and TMA-6 are treasures, both active in similar dosages, and both offer methoxyl groups that are begging to be replaced by other things.\n\nThe first focus was on TMA-2, partly because the needed synthetic chemistry was better known, and partly because I had discovered its activity earlier. But there were three entirely different and distinct methoxyl groups to work on, in TMA-2. There is one at the 2-position, one at the 4-position, and one at the 5-position. The most obvious thing to do, it seemed, was to make each of them one carbon longer. Replace a methoxy with an ethoxy. And a logical naming pattern could follow the use of M for methoxy, and E for ethoxy, in sequence right around the ring from the 2- to the 4- to the 5-positions.\n\nThe first group to be compared, then, would be EMM, MEM, and MME. And of these three, it was only MEM that was right up there in drama and in potency. But, by the time that became apparent, I had already completed the diethoxy possibilities (EEM, EME, and MEE) as well as the triethoxy homologue, EEE. With the discovery that the 4-position was the magic leverage point, and that the homologues at positions 2- and 5- were clearly less interesting, all emphasis was directed at this target, and this has led to the many 4-substituted families that are now known to be highly potent and felt by many to be personally valuable.\n\nWhy put such emphasis on potency, I am frequently asked? Why should it matter how much of a compound you take, as long as the effective level is much lower than its toxic level? Well, in a sense, that is the very reason. There are no guides as to what the toxic levels of any of these many compounds might really be in man. There is simply no way of determining this. Only a few have been explored in animals in the pursuit of an LD-50 level. Most of them are similar to one-another, in that they are, in mice, of relatively low toxicity and, in rat, of relatively high toxicity. But this toxicity appears not to be related to potency in man. So, if one might extrapolate that they are of more or less the same risk to man (from the toxic point of view) then the lower the dosage, the greater the safety. Maybe. In the absence of anything factual, it makes a reasonable operating hypothesis.\n\nMany of the reports of MEM effects have been with experiments in which an effective dose of MDMA had been taken shortly earlier. There has developed a concept, embraced by a number of researchers, that the ease and quietness usually seen with the development of the MDMA experience can mitigate some of the physically disturbing symptoms sometimes seen with other psychedelics. This may be partly due to a familiar entry into an altered place, and partly due to a lessening of dosage usually required for full effects. MEM seems to have had more trials using this combination than many of the other psychedelic drugs.",

I got a call out of absolutely nowhere, from a Stanislov Wistupkin, that he had discovered a number of new psychedelic drugs which he would like to share with me. Two of them were simple phenethylamines, one with an ethoxy group at the 4-position, and one with an allyloxy group there. Both, he said, were mood elevators active between 100 and 300 milligrams.\n\nOne of them was this material, here called MEPEA, and the other one was 3-methoxy-4-allyloxyphenethylamine, or MAPEA. When I did meet him in person, he gave me a most remarkable publication which had been authored some ten years earlier, by a person named Leminger, now dead. It was all in Czech, but quite unmistakably, right there on the third page, were the structures of MEPEA and MAPEA, and the statement that they were active at between 100 and 300 milligrams. I have not yet made the allyloxy compound, but I feel that it too might be a gentle mood elevator similar to the ethoxy.\n\nA most appealing extension of these materials would be the amphetamine derivatives, things with a 3-methoxy group, and something small and terse on the 4-position. The immediate analogies of MEPEA and MAPEA would be 3-methoxy-4-ethoxy- (and 3-methoxy-4-allyloxy)-amphetamine. And equally interesting would be the 4-hydroxy analogue. This would be an easily made compound from vanillin, one of our most enjoyable spices in the kitchen cabinet, and it would be directly related to the essential oils, eugenol and isoeugenol. This amphetamine compound has already been synthesized, but it is still unexplored in man.\n\nSome years ago a report appeared in the forensic literature of Italy, of the seizure of a small semitransparent capsule containing 141 milligrams of a white powder that was stated to be a new hallucinogenic drug. This was shown to contain an analogue of DOM, 3-methoxy-4-methylamphetamine, or MMA. The Italian authorities made no mention of the net weight contained in each dosage unit, but it has been found that the active level of MMA in man is in the area of 40-60 milligrams. The compound can apparently be quite dysphoric, and long lived.\n\nIn the Czechoslovakian publication that presented MEPEA and MAPEA, there were descriptions of escaline (E), proscaline (P), and the allyloxy analogue (AL). These are all active in man, and have been entered elsewhere. This is the only published material dealing with psychedelic drugs I have ever been able to find, from the laboratory of Otakar Leminger. What sort of man was this chemist? He worked for years in industry, and only at the time of his retirement did he publish this little gem. He lived at Usti, directly north of Praha, on the Labe river (which is called by the better known name, the Elbe, as soon as it enters Germany). Might there be other treasures that he had discovered, and never published? Was young Wistupkin a student of his? Are there unrecognized notes of Otakar Leminger sitting in some farm house attic in Northern Czechoslovakia? I extend my heartfelt salute to an almost unknown explorer in the psychedelic drug area.",

The initial human report in the medical literature says only that a dosage of about 100 milligrams produced effects that were similar to those produced by MDA. Both the quality of the experience and the potency of the compound have been modified in more recent publications by the originators of this compound.\n\nA 40 milligram dose, after an induction period of an hour, produced a vague uneasiness that was interpreted originally as a threshold psychedelic effect. At doses in the 60 to 90 milligram range, there were produced feelings of anxiety and paranoid fantasies, and distinct toxic signs such as flushing, palpitations, and occasional nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Any psychedelic effects seem to have been blurred by the more obvious toxic actions of the drug. I have been told that their final conclusion was that the drug appears toxic in the 50 to 60 milligram range. I have not personally explored this positional isomer of DOB.\n\nThe positional isomer of DOB with the bromine in the ortho-position is 4,5-dimethoxy-2-bromoamphetamine and is called, not surprisingly, ORTHO-DOB. It has been made by the condensation of 2-bromo-4,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde with nitroethane to give 1-(2-bromo-4,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-nitropropene with a mp of 105-106 C. Reduction to the amphetamine had to be conducted at a low temperature and using only an equimolar amount of lithium aluminum hydride, to minimize reductive removal of the bromo group. The hydrochloride salt of 2-bromo-4,5-dimethoxyamphetamine (ORTHO-DOB) had a mp of 214-215.5 C, and the hydrobromide salt a melting point of 196-197 C or of 210 C. Both have been reported. The yield from the direct bromination of 3,4-DMA was apparently very bad. I do not think that the compound has ever gone into man.\n\nThere are three other dimethoxyamphetamine isomers known, and each has been explored chemically as to its reactivity with elemental bromine. With 2,3-DMA, a mixture of the 5-Br-2,3-DMA and 6-Br-2,3-DMA was formed; with 2,6-DMA, 3-Br-2,6-DMA was formed; and with 3,5-DMA, a mixture of 2-Br-3,5-DMA and the 2,6-dibromo product was produced. The bromination of 2,5-DMA is, of course, the preferred procedure for the synthesis of 4-Br-2,5-DMA, or DOB, q.v. None of these positional isomers has ever been put into man, but 3-Br-2,6-DMA and the iodo-counterpart have been explored as potential radio-fluorine carriers into the brain. This is all discussed in the 3,4-DMA recipe.",

      "extensions_and_commentary": "This entire venture into the study of TOMSO was an outgrowth of the extraordinary response that had been shown by one person to 5-TOM. There were two obvious approaches that might throw some light on the reason for this dramatic sensitivity. One would be to see if he was unusually capable of metabolizing sulfur-containing molecules, and the second would be to assume he was, and to try to guess just what product he had manufactured with his liver. The individual sensitivity question was addressed in a tidy and direct manner. Why not study a simple sulfur-containing model compound that would probably be metabolized only at the sulfur and that would itself probably be pharmacologically inactive in its own rights? Sounded OK to me, so I made up a goodly supply of 4-tert-butyl thioanisole, which proved to be a gorgeous white crystalline solid. It seemed quite logical that this would be metabolized at the sulfur atom to produce either or both the sulfoxide and the sulfone. So I treated a methanol solution of this with a little hydrogen peroxide and distilled the neutral extracts at 100-115 °C at 0.2 mm/Hg to give the sulfoxide as a solid that melted at 76-77 °C from hexane. On the other hand, if a solution of the thioanisole in acetic acid containing hydrogen peroxide was heated on the steam bath for a few hours and then worked up, a new solid was isolated that proved to be the sulfone (a negative Fries-Vogt test). This was obtained as white crystals with a mp of 94-95 °C from aqueous methanol. And I found that these three compounds separated well from one another by GC, and that they could be extracted from urine. Everything was falling into place. My thought was to determine a safe (inactive) level of the parent thioanisole, and determine the distribution of metabolites in my urine, and then in the urine of several other people, and then finally in the urine of the person who was the intense reactor to 5-TOM. I found that there were no effects, either physical or psychological, at an oral dose of 60 milligrams of 4-tert-butyl-thioanisole. But then everything fell apart. There was not a detectable trace of anything, neither parent compound nor either of the potential metabolites, to be found in my urine. The material was obviously being completely converted to one or more metabolites, but the sulfoxide and sulfone were not among them. It would be fun, someday, to methodically trace the fate of this compound. So, on to the second approach. What might the active metabolite of 5-TOM actually be? The sulfoxide seemed completely reasonable, and that encouraged the synthesis of TOMSO. This name was given, as it is the sulfoxide analogue (SO) of 5-TOM. And since only one of these analogues has been made, the R5S distinction is not needed. But it is apparent that this approach to the finding of an explanation for the idiosyncratic sensitivity to 5-TOM also failed, in that TOMSO itself appeared to be without activity. But the fallout of this study was the uncovering of an unusual property that alcohol can occasionally have when it follows the ingestion of certain inactive drugs. Or if it is used at the tail end of an experience with an active drug. Usually some alcohol has been employed as a softener of the residual effects of the day's experiment, or as a social habit to accompany the post-mortem discussions of a day's experiences, and perhaps as a help to sleeping. But if there is a rekindling of the effect, rather than the sedation expected, then the verb 'to tomso' can be used in the notes. It represents the promotion of an inactive situation into an active one, with the catalysis of alcohol. But the effect is not that of alcohol. Might the extreme sensitivity of some alcoholics to even a small amount of alcohol be due to some endogenous 'inactive' factor that is promoted in this way into some centrally florid toxicity? I remember seeing proposals of some tetrahydroisoquinolines as potential mis-metabolites in efforts to explain the toxicity of alcohol. Maybe they are nothing more than psychedelics that are thought to be inactive, but which might be ignited with a glass of wine. And the person is tomsoing with his small amount of alcohol.",

I have used the term 'scrudge' in this and other recipes, without defining it. With this aldehyde, as with most aldehydes in this nitrostyrene synthesis reaction where there is no ortho-substituent on the benzaldehyde, the reaction progress should be carefully followed by thin-layer chromatography. As the aldehyde disappears from the reaction mixture, the nitrostyrene appears, but there is usually the development of one or more slower moving components as seen by TLC. Such a wrong-product is called scrudge. The reaction should be continuously titrated, and stopped when there is a favorable balance between the aldehyde being mostly gone, the nitrostyrene being mostly made, and the slower-moving scrudge components being not yet too plentiful. Methylene chloride is an excellent solvent to try first, with silica gel plates and UV detection. The nitrostyrene is always the fastest moving component of the reaction mixture and often fluoresces a dull purple. The starting aldehyde is the second spot and usually fluoresces white or pale yellow. The scrudge spots then occur in a cascade from the aldehyde to the origin. A maddening property is that they are yellow or brown colored, and in the probe mass spectrograph they can crack to give rise to what appears to be the right nitrostyrene. Usually, they are high melting. In this preparation, there was not one but several scrudges, and little if any nitrostyrene. The same was true for the other of the diethyl compounds such as 3-TASB, 5-TASB and 3-T-TRIS. Thus, it is preferable to circumvent this usual synthetic step by using the Wittig reaction instead, as described here.",

It stands for 'mescaline units' and was used to give a quantitative measure for the relative potency of a compound. Since it became obvious quite early in these studies that mescaline, although the prototypic compound, was probably going to remain the least potent, it seemed reasonable to use it as a bench mark of unity. By dividing the dose needed of mescaline (to produce central effects) by the dose needed of another drug, one would generate a number that represented just how many times more potent this new drug was than mescaline. I used this term in a very early review of the one-ring psychotomimetics, and it served satisfactorily for quite a while. Its intrinsic worth proved, however, to be its very limitation. It was quickly apparent that the principal value, to behavioral researchers, of the reports of new hallucinogenic drugs, was not in the nature of their action but in the amount of stuff needed to produce that action. This was an essential axis against which the animal pharmacologist could plot his findings. A number was wanted, and the mescaline unit was just that number. Sadly, the major question that is asked by most academic researchers in their evaluation of the psychedelic materials is, 'How much does it take,' rather than 'What does it do.' The marvelous nuances of action, the subtle variations of effect, are dismissed as being hopelessly subjective and thus without scientific worth. But they are, I believe, of great worth.
