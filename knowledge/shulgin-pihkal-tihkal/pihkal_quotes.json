      "extensions_and_commentary": "The extension of the two-carbon chain of mescaline by alpha-methylation to the three carbon chain of TMA approximately doubled the potency of the compound. And it was felt to be a completely logical possibility that, by extending it one more carbon atom, to the four carbon chain of alpha-ethyl-mescaline, it might double again. And following that logical progression, the doubling of potency with each additional carbon atom, the factor would be 2 to the 7th power by the alpha-octyl (or 256x that of mescaline, or a milligram as active dose) and with a side chain of a 70-carbon alkyl group (alpha-heptacontylmescaline) it would take just a single molecule to be intoxicating. This was rich fantasy stuff. As an active compound, just where would it go in the brain? With an 80-carbon side-chain, would one-thousandth of a single molecule be enough for a person? Or might a single molecule intoxicate a thousand people? And how long a chain on the alpha-position might be sufficient that, by merely writing down the structure on a piece of paper, you would get high? Maybe just conceiving the structure in your mind would do it. That is, after all, the way of homeopathy.\n\nMaybe it was just as well that this added two-carbon side-chain with lowered activity was already enough to disprove the doubling pattern. But by the time this non-activity had been learned, the alpha series had already been pushed out quite aways. The machinery of making the appropriate nitroalkane was straightforward, by reaction of the alkyl halide with nitrous acid, and separating the unwanted nitrite ester from the wanted nitroalkane by fractional distillation. The nitrostyrenes all formed reasonably although often in terrible yields, and reduced reasonably, and all formed crystalline picrates for isolation and crystalline hydrochloride salts for pharmacological manipulation. But since the first of these, AEM, was not active, there was no enthusiasm for tasting anything higher. This family was never published; why publish presumably inactive and thus uninteresting material?",

      "extensions_and_commentary": "This specific compound is probably the first sulfur-containing phenethylamine to have been evaluated as a potentially active CNS stimulant or psychedelic. It was a complete, total, absolute unknown. The first trials were made at the sub-microgram level, specifically at 0.25 micrograms, at 11:30 AM on September 3, 1975. Part of this extreme precaution was due to the uniqueness of a new heteroatom in a phenethylamine system. But part was due to the strange manic excitement that occurred at the time of the isolation and characterizing of the final product in the laboratory. Although it was certainly all placebo response, I was jumpy and unable to stay in the lab for more than a few minutes at a time. Maybe dust in the air? Maybe some skin contact with the free base? Now, I know there was nothing, but the possibility of extraordinary potency was real, and I did indeed wash everything down anyway. In fact, it took a total of 18 trials to work the experimental dosage up to as much as a single milligram. In retrospect, overly cautious. But retrospection, as they say, is cheap.\n\nThe 5 milligram experiment, briefly quoted from above, is the stuff of Chapter 14 of this book, important in that it gives an interesting example of some thought processes associated with psychedelic intoxication, ego-inflation, and what might be thought of as bits of mania. As is always the case with peak experiences that happen to be catalyzed by drugs, this extraordinary event could not be duplicated. At 7 milligrams there was an uneventful +1, and some 10 milligrams was needed to generate a full +3 experience. The first clue of the erratic nature of the Aleph family came from an independent assay by a colleague of mine, one who was very familiar with such states of consciousness, but for whom this was not a time for peak experiences. At 10 milligrams he told me that he had had only mild effects which he found relatively uninteresting.\n\nAs it stands, ALEPH remains relatively unexplored. Its two positional isomers are entered here as ORTHO-DOT and META-DOT. Three higher homologues have been more thoroughly looked at, and the generic name ALEPH (the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet) was given this group on the basis that they might have extraordinary properties in common. But the real treasure came in the exploring of the 2-carbon homologues, the compounds that make up the 2C-T family. Here, there proved to be much less uncertainty as to reasonable dosages, and much more richness in the subjective nature of the experience.",

One person had expressed his psychic isolation by taking and maintaining a fetal position in relative hibernation for several hours and with substantial amnesia; this at a four milligram dose. Yet another person, at fully twice this amount, was aware of a slight light-headedness that could in no way be measured as more than a bare threshold. But by the time this erratic nature had become apparent, the ALEPHS had been assigned and made, up to and including ALEPH-7.\n\nALEPH-3 was intended to be the methallylthio compound, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(beta-methallylthio)amphetamine. [Detailed synthesis attempted but abandoned - aldehyde obtained was 'a mess']. Several years later, this entire project was reinitiated, and the aldehyde was obtained as a yellow crystal, but again it was not pursued. At that time, the earlier try had been totally forgotten, and a brand new ALEPH- (or 2C-T-) number had been assigned; i.e., 20. Thus, the corresponding phenethylamine, had it ever been made, which it was not, would have been called either 2C-T-3 or 2C-T-20, and the amphetamine homologue would probably have been ALEPH-20.\n\nA closely related 2C-T-X compound was also started quite a while later - this was the allylthio homologue (2C-T-16). The nitrostyrene was made but has not yet been reduced to the final amine.\n\nALEPH-5 was to be the cyclohexylthio analogue. The nitrostyrene was prepared but 'sits there on the shelf to be reduced to ALEPH-5 some inspired day.' The two-carbon homologue will someday be called 2C-T-5 (if it is ever made).\n\nThe remaining members of this family, ALEPH-4, ALEPH-6, and ALEPH-7 have actually been prepared and they have all been entered here in Book II, under their own names.",

A psychedelic drug experience is a complex combination of many signals going all at the same time. Something like the sound of an oboe playing the notes of the A-major scale. There are events that occur in sequence, such as the initial A, followed by B, followed by C-sharp and on and on. That is the chronology of the experience, and it can be written down as a series of perceived phenomena. The notes of the scale. Black quarter notes, with flags at the tops of their staffs, going up the page of music.\n\nBut within each of these single events, during the sounding of the note 'A,' for example, there is a complex combination of harmonics being produced at the same time, including all components from the fundamental oscillation on up through all harmonics into the inaudible. This mixture defines the played instrument as being an oboe. Each component may be shared by many instruments, but the particular combination is the unique signature of the oboe.\n\nThis analogy applies precisely to the study of psychedelic drugs and their actions. Each drug has a chronology of effect, like the notes of the A-major scale. But there are many components of a drug's action, like the harmonics from the fundamental to the inaudible which, taken in concert, defines the drug. With musical instruments, these components can be shown as sine waves on an oscilloscope. One component, 22%, was a sine wave at a frequency of 1205 cycles, and a phase angle of +55°. But in psychopharmacology? There is no psychic oscilloscope. There are no easily defined and measured harmonics or phase angles. Certainly, any eventual definition of a drug will require some such dissection into components each of which makes some contribution to the complex whole. The mental process may some day be defined by a particular combination of these components. And one of them is this Beth state. It is a state of uncaring, of anhedonia, and of emotionlessness.\n\nMany drugs have a touch of this Beth state, ALEPH-7 more than most. If a sufficient alphabet of effects (I am using the Alephs, Beths, Gimels, and Daleths of the Hebrew as token starters only) were to be accumulated and defined, the actions of new materials might someday be more exactly documented. Could depression, euphoria, and disinhibition for example, all be eventually seen as being made up of their component parts, each contributing in some measured way to the sum, to the human experience? The psychologists of the world would be ecstatic. And drugs such as ALEPH-7 might be useful in helping to define one of these parts.",

Their findings are hard to evaluate, in that 200 milligrams was injected into a 3.75 kilogram cat (53 mg/Kg), or about twice the dosage that they used in their studies with metaescaline. Within 5 minutes there were indications of catatonia, and within a half hour the animal was unable to walk. This condition persisted for two days, at which time the animal died. Although this dose was many times that used in man, perhaps hints of the physical unease and long action are there to be gleaned. The consensus from over a half dozen experiments is that there is not enough value to be had to offset the body load experienced.\n\nA comment is needed on the strange name asymbescaline! In the marvelous world of chemical nomenclature, bi- (or di-) usually means two of something, and tri- and tetra- quite reasonably mean three and four of something. But occasionally there can be an ambiguity with bi (or tri or tetra) in that bi some-thing-or-other might be two something-or-others hooked together or it might be two things hooked onto a something-or-other. So, the former is called bi- and the latter is called bis-. This compound is not two escalines hooked together (bi-escaline) but is only one of them with two ethyl groups attached (bis-escaline or bescaline). And since there are two ways that this can be done (either symmetrically or asymmetrically) the symmetric one is called symbescaline (or SB for short) and this one is called asymbescaline (or ASB for short). To complete the terminology lecture, the term tri- becomes tris- (the name given for the drug with all three ethoxy groups present in place of the methoxys of mescaline) and the term tetra- mutates into the rather incredible tetrakis-!",

And to a large measure this is true with the 4-position homologues of mescaline. This butyl compound, B or Buscaline, had originally been patented in England in 1930 without any physical or pharmacological description, and the few physical studies that had involved it (lipophilic this and serotonin that) suggested that it was less active than mescaline.\n\nIn principle, the 5-, the 6-, the 7- and the on-up homologues might be called amylescaline (possibly pentescaline?), hexescaline, heptescaline (possibly septescaline), and God-knows-what-scaline. They would certainly be easily makeable, but there would be little value that could be anticipated from nibbling them. In keeping with the name B (for butoxy), these would be known as A (for amyloxy, as the use of a P could confuse pentoxy with propoxy), as H (for hexyloxy, but careful; this letter has been used occasionally for DMPEA, which is Homopiperonylamine), and as S (the H for heptyloxy has been consumed by the hexyloxy, so let's shift from the Greek hepta to the Latin septum for the number seven). It seems most likely that the toxic symptoms that might well come along with these phenethylamines would discourage the use of the dosage needed to affect the higher centers of the brain. The same generally negative feeling applies to the amphetamine counterparts 3C-B, 3C-A, 3C-H and 3C-S.\n\nA brief reiteration of the 2C-3C nomenclature, to avoid a possible misunderstanding. The drug 2C-B is so named in that it is the two-carbon chain analogue of the three-carbon chain compound DOB. The drug 3C-B is so named because it is the three-carbon chain analogue of the two-carbon chain compound Buscaline, or more simply, B.

Three milligrams of DOM is a winner, but even ten times this, thirty milligrams of N-methyl-DOM, is somewhat fuzzy. In the rabbit hyperthermia studies, this compound was some 25 times less active than DOM, so even animal tests say this is way down there in value. This particular measure suggests that the active level in man might be 75 milligrams. Well, maybe, but I am not at all comfortable in trying it at that level. In fact I do not intend to explore this any further whatsoever, unless there is a compelling reason, and I see no such reason. For the moment, let us leave this one to others, who might be more adventurous but less discriminating.\n\nIn browsing through my notes I discovered that I had made another N-substitution product of DOM. Efforts to fuse free-base DOM with the ethyl cyclopropane carboxylate failed, but the reaction between it and the acid chloride in pyridine gave the corresponding amide, with a mp of 156-157 °C from MeOH.

So, with DOM being active at maybe 5 milligrams, a logical prediction of the active level of BIS-TOM would be 750 milligrams.

      "extensions_and_commentary": "This compound, BOD, was the first exploratory member of a new family of phenethylamines. This family is called the BOX series, a code that is derived from the unique Beta-methOXy group which is their common feature. The letters B-O-X define an unchanging structural feature, and one needs only add a suffix letter to indicate a specific member of this family. That letter is directly related to the 4-position substituent. The letter 'D' is related to desoxy or methyl, as in DOM, and the other members of this family have a similar nomenclatural genesis. The term BOB comes from the bromine, BOH from the 2-hydroxy (beta-methoxy-2C-H), BOM from the methoxy, and so on.\n\nI came so close to giving one of these materials an extremely inflammatory name. The nitrostyrene that was to be reduced to the free base, was a beta-methoxy derivative, which dictates the BO-something name structure. And the 4-position substituent on the ring was a methylenedioxy group, which is symbolized by 'M'. The temptation was real, but the better angels of my nature prevailed.\n\nThis is as good a place as any to discuss the three-letter acronyms that have become attached to so many drugs. I have heard that the initializing of pharmaceuticals started with the first of the modern psychiatric drugs, chlorpromazine, which was given the name Thorazine by its makers. Whether this was an accident or a plan, every time some character in a movie is given a sedative by a nurse, the audience hears the magic word, Thorazine. Free advertisement forever. It is now the rule rather than the exception to see a drug identified with its three initials. PCP, LSD, DMT, STP, THC, GHB, MDA; they are all instantly recognized. Apparently there is some secret arm of the Government at work, trying to capture all three letter acronyms for themselves. There is the CIA, the DEA, the FBI, the FDA, the IRS, the INS, and many others. Maybe there is an unknown body, the United Amalgamation of Government Acronym Swipers, known only by its acronym, UAGAS.\n\nA small detour into biochemistry. The decarboxylation product of tyrosine is tyramine. The para-hydroxylation product of tyramine is dopamine. The beta-hydroxylation product of dopamine is norepinephrine. Now, where would one find tyrosine without the para-hydroxy group? Why, in phenylalanine, of course. And what is the decarboxylation product of phenylalanine? It is phenethylamine. And what is the beta-hydroxy derivative of phenethylamine? It is a compound known as phenylethanolamine. And what is the para-hydroxy derivative of phenylethanolamine? It is a compound which was first found in nature, not in the human, but in the salivary glands of the octopus. And so it is called octopamine. And I have always wanted to express my admiration and respect for whoever it was, who was curious enough about what might be in the salivary glands of the octopus, to actually look. My kind of scientist.\n\nA few words on optical isomers here. This is a family of compounds that has an asymmetric carbon atom in the aliphatic chain. It is called the beta-carbon atom, and it is the one that carries the methoxy group. So, there must always be two isomers, an 'R' and an 'S', or to use the older nomenclature, a 'D' and an 'L', and the synthetic material will always be the 50/50 mixture known as the racemate.\n\nThere is an ethoxy homologue of this compound (BOED) that has been synthesized and evaluated. At levels between 70 and 75 milligrams, there was a consistent experience of about 10 hours duration, distinctly less intense than BOD itself. Higher levels have not been explored.",

The BOH name for this member of the BOX family follows the convention discussed in the BOD recipe--with RHS for homopiperonylamine, the simplest of the muni-metro family, q.v. The demethylated homologue of BOH is BOHH, and is the methylenedioxy analogue of norepinephrine. It might well hydrolytically open up in the body to provide this neurotransmitter, and serve as some sort of transmitter in its own right. It is discussed under DME.\n\nMaybe there is something to the concept that when you imitate a neurotransmitter too closely, you get a hybrid gemisch of activity. The term \"pro-drug\" is used to identify a compound that may not be intrinsically active, but one which metabolizes in the body to provide an active drug. I feel the term should have been pre-drug, but pro-drug was the word that caught on. BOH may well act in the body as a pro-drug to norepinephrine, but with the temporary blocking of the polar functions with ether groups, it can gain access to the brain. And once there, it can be stripped of these shields and play a direct neurological role. I uncovered a very similar analogy in the tryptamine world some years ago. Just as norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter, so is serotonin. And I found that by putting an O-ether on the indolic phenol (to hide its polarity) and an alpha-methyl group next to the primary amine (to protect it from metabolic deaminase), it became an extremely potent, and most complex, psychedelic. This was the compound alpha,O-dimethylserotonin, or a,O-DMS. There is an uncanny analogy between this tryptamine and the phenethylamine BOH.\n\nSomehow the quiet voice deep inside me says, don't use too much, too quickly. Maybe one of the optical isomers is the body thing, and the other isomer is the mind thing. So far, only the racemic mixture has been tasted, to the best of my knowledge.",

      "extensions_and_commentary": "The usual method of making beta-ethanolamine such as this is through the reduction of the cyanohydrin of the corresponding benzaldehyde and, in fact, that method is described in the recipe for DME. This above procedure was actually part of an exploration of different agents that might be used in the reduction of the intermediate nitroalkane. This product was the unexpected result of trying zinc.\n\nWhy the potent cardiovascular effect seen by this compound? There are a couple of points that might argue for some adrenolytic toxicity. This material is a beta-ethanolamine and, with maybe one or two exceptions, clinically used beta-receptor blockers are beta-ethanolamines. In fact, a few of these so-called beta-blockers actually have two methoxy groups on the aromatic rings, also a property of BOHD. The antidiabetic drug Butaxamine (BW 64-9 in the code of Burroughs Wellcome) is identical to BOHD except that the 4-methyl group is on the alpha-carbon instead, and there is a tertiary butyl group on the nitrogen atom. Another point involves the proximity of the beta-hydroxy group and the methoxyl oxygen atom in the 2-position of the ring. There is going to be a strong hydrogen-bonding with this orientation, with the formation of a stable six-membered ring. This might help obscure the hydrophilic nature of the free hydroxyl group and allow the compound to pass into the brain easily. If this group is masked by an easily removed group such as an acetate ester, one gets the compound beta-acetoxy-3,4-dimethoxy-4-methylphenethylamine (BOAD) which is similar to BOHD as a hypotensive.\n\nThe code-naming procedure used here (and elsewhere here in Book II) is: (1) to use RBOS as the alert to there being an oxygen on the benzyl carbon of a phenethylamine (it is a benzyl alcohol); (2) if there is just one more letter (a third and last letter) it will identify the 2C-X parent from which it has been derived [RBS comes from 2C-B, RDS comes from 2C-D, RHS comes from homopiperonylamine (MDPEA) rather than from 2C-H, RMS comes from mescaline, and in every case the beta-substituent is a methoxy group]; and (3) if there are four letters, then the fourth letter is as above, and the third letter (the next to last letter) is the substituent on that benzylic oxygen. With a three letter code, the substituent is a methyl group, an RHS for a third letter of four makes it a hydroxyl group, and an RAS for the third letter is an acetyl group, and an RES is for an ethyl group. A similar sort of cryptographic music was composed by Du Pont in their three-number codes for the Freons. The first number was one less than the number of carbons in the molecule, the second number was one more than the number of hydrogens in the molecule, the third number was the exact number of fluorines in the molecule, and the rest of the bonds were filled with chlorines, Thus Freon 11 (really Freon 011) was trichlorofluoromethane and Freon 116 was hexafluoroethane.\n\nComplex, yes. But both systems are completely straightforward, and flexible for future creations. A few additional examples of similar beta-ethanolamines are scattered throughout Book II and they have, in general, proved to be uninteresting, at least as potential psychedelic compounds.",
