  "abstract": "This paper presents a unified framework integrating modern physics theories of time (Block Universe, Eternalism, Relativity of Simultaneity) with ancient theological concepts (Aquinas's divine atemporality, the Fates as weavers of time) and emerging consciousness preservation technologies (AI, cloning, genetic memory). The central thesis proposes that time, as experienced by human beings, operates as a spiral descent through a cone-shaped structure (analogous to gravitational flow), while certain entities—identified variously as Egregori, Angels, Metatron, or the Fates—exist perpendicular to this spiral, allowing them access to what we perceive as past, present, and future simultaneously.",
