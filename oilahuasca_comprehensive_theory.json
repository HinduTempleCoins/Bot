    "description": "A sophisticated biochemical mechanism by which common culinary ingredients can be combined to activate naturally occurring allylbenzenes (found in nutmeg and other spices) into psychoactive compounds through endogenous amine adduct formation.",

  "oilahuasca_definition": {
    "what_is_it": "Oilahuasca is a term describing the synergistic combination of nutmeg (containing myristicin, elemicin, and 5-methoxyeugenol), coffee (containing caffeine and β-carbolines: harman and norharman), cinnamon (glutathione depleter via cinnamaldehyde), vanilla (glutathione depleter), and almond (benzaldehyde compounds affecting metabolism).",
    "name_origin": "The name derives from ayahuasca, the traditional Amazonian brew that combines DMT-containing plants with MAO-inhibiting plants (typically Banisteriopsis caapi containing β-carbolines). Similarly, oilahuasca combines psychoactive precursors (allylbenzenes) with compounds that modulate their metabolism through enzyme manipulation."
