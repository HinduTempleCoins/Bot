What obscured these connections was the imposition of modern racial categories, nationalist historiography, and academic compartmentalization.",

      "Carthaginians were Western Phoenicians (Punics), who were Canaanites, who were Semitic peoples—the same cultural sphere as the ancient Hebrews",
      "Biblical text extensively documents these peoples despite modern claims of 'silence' about Phoenicians",
      "Greek mythology preserved what political history obscured—connecting Libya, Egypt, Phoenicia, and Crete through genealogical frameworks",
      "Persian-Babylonian-Jewish relations were diplomatic and collaborative, not primarily adversarial",
      "Modern entertainment (Ghostbusters, Fantasy Island, etc.) retained ancient knowledge that academia dismissed",
      "Geographic proximity makes the connections obvious: Lebanon (Phoenician heartland) is directly north of Israel"
