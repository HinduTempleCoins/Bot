      "modern_correction": "The 'ammonia addition' doesn't happen as simply as Shulgin theorized in 1963. Instead: liver enzymes create 1'-oxo intermediates, these condense with endogenous amines (not ammonia), products are aminopropiophenones NOT amphetamines. But the basic principle holds: essential oils → psychoactive metabolites",
