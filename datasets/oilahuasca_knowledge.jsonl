This is analogous to how ayahuasca uses MAO inhibitors to potentiate DMT. The term was coined by researcher Ron69. Key finding: allylbenzenes metabolize to tertiary aminopropiophenones (NOT amphetamines as originally theorized by Shulgin). CYP450 enzyme manipulation can dramatically enhance bioavailability and duration.", "created_at": "2026-01-12T00:00:00Z"}
